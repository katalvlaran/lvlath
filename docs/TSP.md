# 11. Traveling Salesman Problem

> **Package:** `lvlath/tsp` | **Focus:** Deterministic Matrix TSP, Exact Search, Christofides, Blossom MWPM, Local Search, Contract-Safe Results

The `lvlath/tsp` package is a deterministic, contract-driven routing kernel over `matrix.Matrix`. It solves TSP and supported ATSP regimes by making algorithmic strength explicit: exact solvers publish optimality only when they complete, Christofides publishes a formal approximation ratio only under exact Blossom matching, Greedy matching is a selected weaker mode, and local search returns improved tours without global optimality claims.

The package is designed for production pipelines where matrix order, error identity, numeric validity, result ownership, and deterministic tie-breaking are not implementation details. They are part of the public contract.

---

## 11.1. What & Why: The Laws of `tsp`

TSP models a closed route that visits every required vertex exactly once and returns to a fixed start. The cost matrix may represent kilometers, minutes, millisecond actuator latency, fuel burn, temperature-degradation risk, security exposure, or any non-negative application-specific penalty.

### The Seven Laws

1. **Matrix-Source Law**

   Solver kernels consume `matrix.Matrix`. Graph data may be adapted into a matrix by a facade, but Held-Karp, Branch-and-Bound, Christofides, matching, Eulerian, and local-search kernels operate on matrix indices.

   Consequence: row and column order define the algorithmic vertex order. Optional `IDs` are labels over that order, not an alternate topology.

2. **Explicit Policy Law**

   `Options` is a runtime policy object. It selects algorithm, symmetry, matching engine, local-search limits, metric-closure behavior, deterministic randomness, exact-solver guards, and timeout policy. It must not silently mutate topology or silently substitute a weaker algorithm.

3. **Determinism Law**

   For the same matrix, IDs, options, seed, and package version, successful results are deterministic. Stable behavior comes from matrix order, vertex-index tie-breaks, dense edge IDs, deterministic matching selection, deterministic Eulerian traversal, and documented local-search enumeration.

4. **Numeric Discipline Law**

   NaN, `-Inf`, and negative finite weights are invalid. `+Inf` is a missing-edge sentinel only before metric closure. Final solver kernels require complete finite matrices.

5. **Matching Publication Law**

   `BlossomMatch` means exact minimum-weight perfect matching on Christofides odd MST vertices. Only this mode supports publishing the Christofides `1.5` approximation ratio. `GreedyMatch` is deterministic and intentional, but it publishes no formal ratio.

6. **Result Ownership Law**

   `TSPResult` owns detached `Tour` and `IDs` slices. `Clone()` deep-copies mutable result surfaces. `VertexTour()` projects indices through the detached ID mapping without recomputing a route.

7. **Partial-Result Safety Law**

   Validation and construction failures return `nil` result plus error. Governed timeout exceptions are explicit: Branch-and-Bound may return an incumbent, and direct local-search wrappers may return the current feasible tour, but such results must not be marked globally optimal.

---

## 11.2. Domain Scope & Non-Goals

### Solved domain

`lvlath/tsp` covers:
- exact Held-Karp dynamic programming for guarded small instances;
- exact Branch-and-Bound with deterministic branching and optional lower bounds;
- Christofides for symmetric complete metric TSP;
- exact Blossom MWPM for Christofides odd-vertex matching;
- deterministic Greedy matching as an explicit weaker Christofides mode;
- 2-opt and 3-opt local search, including restricted directed behavior;
- optional metric closure for missing `+Inf` edges before final solving;
- Eulerian multigraph construction, parallel-edge-safe circuit traversal, and shortcutting;
- tour validation, rotation, orientation canonicalization, cost evaluation, and ID projection.

### Non-goals

The package intentionally does not provide:
- hidden exact-to-heuristic fallback;
- hidden Blossom-to-Greedy fallback;
- silent solver substitution after a selected policy fails;
- Concorde-style branch-and-cut;
- sparse graph-native TSP kernels;
- final solving over unresolved `+Inf`;
- full arbitrary-reconnection ATSP 3-opt;
- concurrent mutation support for caller-owned matrix or graph inputs;
- snapshot isolation against external input mutation;
- machine-readable error strings;
- approximation-ratio claims for Greedy matching or local search.

### Graph boundary

`core.Graph` represents topology. `tsp` kernels represent matrix optimization. A graph facade may produce a `matrix.Matrix`; after that boundary, solver semantics are matrix semantics. This avoids mixed-edge ambiguity, graph mutation races, and endpoint-direction confusion inside solver kernels.

---

## 11.3. Mathematical Formulation

### Closed-tour objective

Let `V = {0, ..., n-1}` and let `π` be a permutation of `V` with `π_0 = s`. A closed tour appends `π_n = π_0`.

$$ \operatorname{cost}(\pi)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c(\pi_i,\pi_{i+1}), \qquad \pi_n=\pi_0 $$

The public tour surface must satisfy:
$$ Tour[0]=StartVertex,\quad Tour[n]=StartVertex,\quad Tour[0:n]\text{ is a permutation of }V $$

For symmetric TSP:
$$ c(u,v)=c(v,u) $$

For ATSP:

$$ c(u,v)\text{ may differ from }c(v,u) $$

### Held-Karp dynamic program

Let `DP[S][j]` be the minimum cost to start at `s`, visit exactly the subset `S`, and finish at `j`.

$$ DP[S][j]=\min_{i\in S\setminus\{j\}}\left(DP[S\setminus\{j\}][i]+c(i,j)\right) $$

Initialization and closure:
$$ DP[\{s\}][s]=0 $$

$$ OPT=\min_{j\in V\setminus\{s\}}\left(DP[V][j]+c(j,s)\right) $$

Complexity:
$$ T=O(n^2 2^n), \qquad S=O(n2^n) $$

The implementation is size-guarded by exact-solver policy. `Auto` may use `MaxExactN` to decide whether exact Held-Karp is admissible for automatic dispatch.

### Branch-and-Bound exactness

Branch-and-Bound searches over partial paths. A lower bound must be admissible:
$$ LB(P)\le OPT(P) $$

A branch can be pruned only when it cannot improve the incumbent:
$$ LB(P)\ge Cost(Incumbent)-\varepsilon $$

Exactness is a completion property. If search is stopped by a time limit, a feasible incumbent is not a proof of optimality.

### Degree-1 and one-tree lower-bound intuition

A Hamiltonian cycle gives each vertex one incoming and one outgoing edge. Degree-relaxation bounds use this necessity to estimate the cheapest possible completion. For symmetric one-tree relaxation, reduced costs are:
$$ c'(u,v)=c(u,v)+\pi_u+\pi_v $$

The subgradient signal is degree violation:
$$ g_v=deg(v)-2 $$

Every Hamiltonian cycle is a feasible one-tree, but not every one-tree is a Hamiltonian cycle. That is why one-tree is a lower bound, not a route constructor.

### Christofides law

For symmetric complete metric TSP:
$$ T = MST(G) $$

$$ O=\{v\in V \mid deg_T(v)\equiv 1 \pmod 2\} $$

$$ M = MWPM(G[O]) $$

$$ H = T \cup M $$

Every vertex in `H` has even degree:
$$ \forall v\in V,\quad deg_H(v)\equiv0\pmod2 $$

Shortcutting an Eulerian circuit produces a Hamiltonian tour because the metric triangle inequality prevents shortcut cost from increasing.

Formal ratio, published only with exact Blossom MWPM:
$$ cost(C)\le\frac{3}{2}cost(OPT) $$

### Eulerian multigraph law

Christofides uses an undirected multigraph. Parallel edges are legal and must be consumed exactly once. Half-edge pairing is directional:
$$ (u\rightarrow v)\text{ pairs with }(v\rightarrow u) $$

It is incorrect to pair two grouped half-edges of the same direction, even if they share the same unordered pair.

### Local-search move laws

For symmetric 2-opt, removing edges `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` and reconnecting `(a,c)` and `(b,d)` changes cost by:
$$ \Delta = c(a,c)+c(b,d)-c(a,b)-c(c,d) $$

A move is accepted only when:
$$ \Delta < -\varepsilon $$

For directed 2-opt*, the move is orientation-preserving: it rewires tails rather than reversing a segment. The directed mode must not be described as full arbitrary ATSP 3-opt.

## 11.5. Options, Numeric Policy & Error Law

### Options

```go
type Options struct {
    StartVertex int
    Algo        Algorithm
    Symmetric   bool

    MatchingAlgo MatchingAlgo
    BoundAlgo    BoundAlgo

    RunMetricClosure bool

    EnableLocalSearch bool
    TwoOptMaxIters    int
    ThreeOptMaxMoves  int

    BestImprovement     bool
    ShuffleNeighborhood bool

    Eps       float64
    TimeLimit time.Duration
    Seed      int64

    MaxExactN int
}
```

Options describe solver policy. They must not mutate topology and must not silently replace the selected algorithm.

| Option field          | Contract                                                                 |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Algo`                | Selects the solver family.                                               |
| `Symmetric`           | Declares whether symmetric TSP rules are required.                       |
| `StartVertex`         | Fixes tour start and closure vertex.                                     |
| `MatchingAlgo`        | Selects `BlossomMatch` or `GreedyMatch` for Christofides.                |
| `BoundAlgo`           | Selects Branch-and-Bound lower-bound policy.                             |
| `RunMetricClosure`    | Allows `+Inf` missing edges to be resolved before final solving.         |
| `EnableLocalSearch`   | Enables dispatcher-managed local-search post-processing where supported. |
| `TwoOptMaxIters`      | Bounds accepted 2-opt moves; zero means unlimited.                       |
| `ThreeOptMaxMoves`    | Bounds accepted 3-opt moves; zero means unlimited.                       |
| `BestImprovement`     | Controls local-search improvement policy where supported.                |
| `ShuffleNeighborhood` | Enables deterministic seed-controlled neighborhood shuffling.            |
| `Eps`                 | Controls strict improvement and equality decisions.                      |
| `TimeLimit`           | Governs supported soft time-budget behavior; zero means unlimited.       |
| `Seed`                | Controls deterministic randomized components.                            |
| `MaxExactN`           | Bounds exact Held-Karp selection when `Algo==Auto`.                      |

`DefaultOptions()` selects Christofides, symmetric input, Greedy matching, no metric closure, and local search enabled. `BlossomMatch` is available as an explicit caller-selected policy when the caller requires exact MWPM semantics and formal Christofides ratio publication.

### Numeric policy

- `DefaultEps = 1e-12`.
- `NoApproximationRatio = 0.0`.
- `ChristofidesApproximationRatio = 1.5`.
- NaN is invalid.
- `-Inf` is invalid.
- Negative finite weights are invalid.
- `+Inf` is a pre-kernel missing-edge sentinel only when closure policy allows it.
- Final kernels require finite complete costs.
- Strict symmetry is required by `Christofides`, by `OneTreeBound`, and whenever `Symmetric` is true.
- Costs are stabilized for publication by package rounding policy.

### Error law

Use `errors.Is`. Do not parse strings.

```go
if errors.Is(err, tsp.ErrTimeLimit) {
    // Handle governed timeout behavior.
}
```

Errors may be wrapped to preserve context. Sentinel identity remains the machine contract.

### 11.7.1. Christofides route pressure on a cold-chain dispatch matrix

This diagram explains how the cold-chain example works. The full solver receives a complete 10x10 matrix. The diagram shows the final deterministic route reported by the example, not every matrix edge.

Traversal order (the exact manifest published by Example 11.8.1):

  00 -> 02 -> 03 -> 05 -> 07 -> 09 -> 08 -> 04 -> 01 -> 06 -> 00

Because the margin is positive, the documented route stays inside the configured
thermal envelope and the example publishes:

- `closed=true`
- `minutes=200.0`
- `thermal-margin=40.0`
- `status=within-envelope`

Approximation interpretation:

- The example prints `ratio=1.5`.
- This is the **published Christofides worst-case guarantee** for metric symmetric TSP.
- It is **not** a measured `tour_cost / optimal_cost` quotient for this concrete instance.
- The guarantee is valid here because the example uses `Christofides` on a symmetric complete metric-style matrix together with `MatchingAlgo = BlossomMatch`.

Interpretation:
  200 <= 240, so the route is inside the validated thermal envelope.
  The 1.5 ratio is publishable because the example explicitly selects BlossomMatch.
```

### 11.7.2. Christofides algorithm stages over the same matrix

The route is not constructed by greedily walking the cheapest visible corridor. Christofides creates a structural skeleton, repairs parity with matching, traverses an Eulerian multigraph, and shortcuts repeated vertices.

Exactness law:
  If search completes, incumbent is globally optimal.
  If timeout interrupts search, incumbent may be feasible but not certified optimal.

### 11.7.6. Directed 2-opt* route improvement boundary

Directed local search must not reverse the middle segment as symmetric 2-opt does. ATSP arc directions carry meaning.

## 11.8. Go Example Scenarios

The examples below use static matrices with 8 to 10 vertices. They show realistic build, execute, and consume pipelines with explicit setup and solver error handling.

### 11.8.1. Biopharmaceutical cold-chain dispatch

A vaccine distribution hub must deliver to hospitals, emergency depots, and mobile units before validated cold-chain containment expires. The matrix stores peak-window travel minutes, not physical distance. The example selects Christofides with Blossom matching because the matrix is symmetric and the caller wants the published `1.5` approximation certificate.

The resulting route uses `200` minutes inside a `240` minute envelope. That is a valid dispatch with `40` minutes of operational margin. If the margin were negative, the correct operational response would be split routing, additional vehicle capacity, or a different matrix policy, not ignoring the result.

### 11.8.2. High-value cash-in-transit ATSP risk routing

This example models a directed security route. The matrix combines travel time, fuel burn, escort availability, and exposure risk. Direction matters: returning through the same corridor may have a different risk score because of one-way streets, turn restrictions, and predictable attack surfaces.

The example uses `TwoOptSearch` rather than the `SolveMatrix` dispatcher because the operation starts from a manually approved security corridor. Local search may improve that corridor, but it never claims exactness or global optimality.

    }

### 11.8.3. Semiconductor laser-drilling exact optimization

An industrial laser-drilling workstation visits microscopic via-hole positions on each board. The matrix stores servo motion and stabilization latency in milliseconds. At 100,000 boards per production batch, a few milliseconds per board become minutes of machine occupancy.

This example uses exact Branch-and-Bound with `OneTreeBound`. The output is exact and optimal because the search completes.

## 11.9. Laws of Ownership, Concurrency & Partial Results

### Ownership

`TSPResult` is detached. `Clone()` deep-copies `Tour` and `IDs`, preserves scalar metadata, and returns nil for a nil receiver. `VertexTour()` allocates a detached `[]string` and maps indices through `IDs` left-to-right.

Caller mutation of the returned `Tour`, `IDs`, clone, or vertex tour must not mutate solver state or the source result.

### Matrix ownership

Solvers treat input matrices as immutable during execution. Metric closure, when requested, uses detached storage. The package does not provide snapshot isolation against external concurrent mutation of a caller-owned matrix.

### Concurrency

Supported:
```text
goroutine A: SolveMatrix(matrixA, idsA, optsA)
goroutine B: SolveMatrix(matrixB, idsB, optsB)
```

Supported by convention for immutable shared input:
```text
goroutine A: SolveMatrix(sharedReadOnlyMatrix, ids, opts)
goroutine B: SolveMatrix(sharedReadOnlyMatrix, ids, opts)
```

Unsupported:
```text
goroutine A: SolveMatrix(sharedMatrix, ids, opts)
goroutine B: sharedMatrix.Set(i, j, value)
```

### Partial results

Hard validation and construction failures suppress results:
```text
result == nil
err != nil
```

Branch-and-Bound timeout with incumbent:
```text
result != nil
errors.Is(err, tsp.ErrTimeLimit)
result.TimedOut == true
result.Optimal == false
```

Direct local-search timeout with current feasible tour:
```text
result != nil
errors.Is(err, tsp.ErrTimeLimit)
result.Exact == false
result.Optimal == false
```

Timeout without feasible tour:
```text
result == nil
errors.Is(err, tsp.ErrTimeLimit)
```

## 11.10. Pitfalls

> **Do not parse error strings.**
>
>    Use `errors.Is`; wrapped context is for diagnostics.

> **Do not assume `DefaultOptions()` publishes Christofides `1.5`.**
>
>    The current default matching policy is explicit Greedy matching. Set `MatchingAlgo = BlossomMatch` when exact MWPM and the formal ratio are required.

> **Do not run Christofides on asymmetric input.**
>
>    Christofides is a symmetric metric TSP algorithm. Directed risk matrices belong to ATSP-capable exact or local-search regimes.

> **Do not send unresolved `+Inf` into final kernels.**
>
>    Enable metric closure where appropriate or reject the instance.

> **Do not treat 2-opt or 3-opt as exact.**
>
>    They are local-search heuristics and must not publish global optimality.

> **Do not describe restricted ATSP 3-opt* as full ATSP 3-opt.**
>
>    The directed mode preserves orientation and does not enumerate every arbitrary directed reconnection.

> **Do not mutate matrices while solving.**
>
>    External mutation voids deterministic and numeric correctness assumptions.

> **Do not reintroduce metadata-dropping result projections.**
>
>    `TSPResult` is the canonical result artifact.

> **Do not hide selected-algorithm failures with weaker fallback.**
>
>    If a caller selected Blossom and it fails, surfacing the error preserves the matching law.

> **Do not deduplicate Christofides multigraph parallel edges.**
>
>    Parallel edges are part of the Eulerian multigraph and must be consumed exactly once.

---

## 11.11. Best Practices

> **Use `SolveMatrix` as the canonical integration facade.**
>
>    It preserves matrix semantics, IDs, metric-closure metadata, and result publication policy.

>  **Use direct wrappers when the algorithm is fixed by the product requirement.**
>
>    `BranchAndBoundSolve`, `ChristofidesSolve`, `TwoOptSearch`, and `ThreeOptSearch` avoid accidental dispatcher ambiguity.

> **Set `MatchingAlgo = BlossomMatch` explicitly for Christofides guarantees.**
>
>    The ratio is a proof artifact, not a general Christofides label.

> **Use `OneTreeBound` for symmetric exact Branch-and-Bound pruning.**
>
>    It can strengthen pruning without changing exactness.

> **Use domain units directly.**
>
>    Minutes, milliseconds, fuel, and risk scores are valid as long as they are finite, non-negative, and consistently interpreted.

> **Pass IDs aligned with matrix rows.**
>
>    IDs make `VertexTour()` useful and preserve operational traceability.

> **Use `Clone()` before handing results to mutable consumers.**
>
>    This keeps published solver snapshots protected from caller-side mutation.

> **Use metric closure as an explicit modeling decision.**
>
>    Closure replaces missing direct edges with shortest-path costs; that changes the effective matrix.

> **Read certificates, not only cost.**
>
>    Check `Exact`, `Optimal`, `TimedOut`, `ApproximationRatio`, `MetricClosureApplied`, and `Symmetric`.

> **Benchmark real regimes.**
>
>    Build matrices and options before `b.ResetTimer`, call `b.ReportAllocs`, and avoid setup work inside hot loops.
