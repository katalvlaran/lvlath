  lvlath - Repository README

  Purpose:
    This README is the public face of lvlath. It presents the library as a
    deterministic, contract-driven Go toolkit for graph algorithms, flow networks,
    dense graph algebra, routing, time-series alignment, and reproducible
    algorithm engineering. It should give a new reader immediate confidence in
    what lvlath can solve, how packages compose, where the formal contracts live,
    and why this repository is engineered beyond ad-hoc algorithm snippets.

# lvlath

**lvlath** is a pure-Go algorithm engineering library for graphs, flows, dense graph algebra, routing, time-series alignment, and reproducible test fixtures.

It is built for people who need algorithmic tools they can explain in a code review, trust in CI, compose across packages, and debug from deterministic artifacts instead of guessing why an answer changed.

**The core promise:**

> Same graph, same options, same algorithm - same result surface, same witness semantics, same failure class.

`lvlath` is not just “BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and friends.” It is a small ecosystem where:

* `core.Graph` gives deterministic, thread-safe topology with explicit capabilities;
* traversal packages publish meaningful result artifacts, not incidental internal state;
* weighted routing keeps `+Inf`, unknown targets, disabled path tracking, and unreachable targets separate;
* `matrix` turns topology into dense numeric objects without erasing zero-weight or metric-closure semantics;
* flow, MST, TSP, DTW, grid, and builder packages extend the same discipline into optimization, alignment, fixtures, and examples.

---

## Why lvlath exists

A graph or numeric-algorithm library becomes dangerous when the demo works, but the production system loses ordering, topology meaning, numeric semantics, or error identity.

The common failures are familiar:

* Go map iteration leaks into traversal order;
* directed, undirected, mixed, loop, and multi-edge semantics are guessed instead of modeled;
* zero-weight edges disappear inside adjacency matrices;
* `+Inf` is replaced with “large enough” constants and later becomes a fake route;
* BFS is used for weighted routing because it “looks like pathfinding”;
* Dijkstra, MST, TSP, and DTW are treated as interchangeable shortest-cost tools;
* DFS discovery order is confused with finish order;
* max-flow examples print only a number and hide residual-network semantics;
* Christofides is claimed without checking metric assumptions or matching strength;
* DTW path output is requested from a memory mode that intentionally discarded history;
* examples panic, print unstable maps, or silently rely on fictional APIs;
* documentation explains textbook theory but not the actual package contract.

`lvlath` is built against those failure modes. It is an algorithm engineering library: each package publishes a narrow mathematical contract, validates its input domain, returns meaningful result artifacts, and keeps deterministic behavior observable.

### The repository-level laws

1. **Determinism is a package contract**

   `core` provides stable graph surfaces. Algorithm packages either preserve that order or define their own deterministic tie-breaks: BFS processing order, DFS finish order, Dijkstra strict improvement, MST edge ordering, DTW backtracking, TSP matrix order and solver tie-breaks.

2. **Capabilities are declared before topology is trusted**

   Directedness, weighting, loops, multi-edges, and mixed-edge behavior are graph capabilities, not comments. Invalid topology should be rejected at the write or validation boundary, not discovered after an algorithm has already published nonsense.

3. **Every non-trivial algorithm publishes a result artifact**

   BFS `Result`, DFS `Result`, Dijkstra `Result`, MST `Result`, TSP `Result`, DTW `Result`, residual flow graphs, adjacency matrices, incidence matrices, and metric closures are caller-owned artifacts with domain meaning. They are not incidental internal state.

4. **Errors are protocol, not prose**

   Public errors are meant for `errors.Is`. Error text is diagnostic only. A caller must be able to distinguish “unknown target,” “known unreachable,” “path not tracked,” “disconnected strict MST,” “invalid matching policy,” and “time-limited incumbent.”

5. **Policy must be explicit**

   Filters, cutoffs, thresholds, forest mode, metric closure, local search, matching engine, DTW window, memory mode, slope penalty, and TSP time limits are explicit policy choices. No package should silently swap to weaker mathematics because the selected one is inconvenient.

6. **Numeric semantics are not interchangeable**

   `0`, `+Inf`, `NaN`, negative weights, missing edges, zero-cost edges, unreachable states, and local costs mean different things in different packages. `matrix`, `dtw`, `mst`, `dijkstra`, and `tsp` intentionally enforce different numeric laws because they solve different problems.

7. **Graph algorithms and dense algebra compose without erasing meaning**

   `matrix` can convert topology into adjacency, incidence, metric closure, statistics, and factorization workflows. It must preserve zero-weight and `+Inf` semantics instead of flattening them into convenient but false dense arrays.

8. **Documentation, examples, tests, and source must describe the same library**

   `{package}/doc.go` is the implemented API contract. `docs/{PACKAGE}.md` teaches the mathematics and operational pitfalls. Examples demonstrate real package behavior. Tests defend the contract. None of them should invent future APIs or convenient lies.

## Quick start A: graph “lvlath” - shapes, components, cycles, matrix view

This is the first visual example: a graph is not only “nodes and edges”; it is a controllable topology that can be inspected, transformed, and projected into matrix form.

The old `lvlath` letter sketch is preserved, but the implementation style is updated to current error-returning constructors and deterministic package contracts.

```text
Six disconnected glyph components:

   l₁            v           l₂            a               t             h
  top                       top         tail──top         top           top
   │                         │                 │           |             │
 middle      left right   middle    middleL──circle  left-cross-right  middle──right
   │            \ /          │          │      │           │             │      │
 base──tail    center      base──tail  baseL──base       base──tail    base  baseR

Expected component count: 6
Expected cycle count:     1   // the internal cycle in the letter “a”
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/bfs"

func main() {
	g, err := core.NewGraph()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Static example data. Ignoring AddEdge errors is acceptable here only because
	// all vertices, weights, and capabilities are predetermined. In production,
	// check every returned error.

	// l₁
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("l1_top", "l1_middle", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("l1_middle", "l1_base", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("l1_base", "l1_tail_base_right", 0)

	// a: the only cyclic glyph.
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_tail_top_left", "a_top", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_top", "a_circle_middle", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_circle_middle", "a_circle_base", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_circle_base", "a_circle_base_left", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_circle_base_left", "a_circle_middle_left", 0)
	_, _ = g.AddEdge("a_circle_middle_left", "a_circle_middle", 0)

	components, err := bfs.Components(context.Background(), g)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	cycles := g.EdgeCount() - g.VertexCount() + components.Count
	fmt.Println("components:", components.Count)
	fmt.Println("cyclomatic:", cycles)

	// Deterministic induced view of the letter “a”.
	aVertices := map[string]bool{
		"a_tail_top_left":     true,
		"a_top":               true,
		"a_circle_middle":     true,

	}

	sub, err := core.NewGraph()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	for id := range aVertices {
		_ = sub.AddVertex(id)
	}
	for _, e := range g.Edges() {
		if aVertices[e.From] && aVertices[e.To] {
			_, _ = sub.AddEdge(e.From, e.To, 0)
		}
	}

	mOpts, _ := matrix.NewMatrixOptions(
		matrix.WithUnweighted(),
		matrix.WithAllowLoops(),
	)
	
	am, err := matrix.NewAdjacencyMatrix(sub, mOpts)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	degree, err := am.DegreeVector()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	ids := make([]string, 0, len(am.VertexIndex))
	for id := range am.VertexIndex {
		ids = append(ids, id)
	}
	sort.Strings(ids)
	for _, id := range ids {
		fmt.Printf("degree[%s]=%.0f\n", id, degree[am.VertexIndex[id]])
	}
}
```

What this demonstrates:

* `core` gives safe, deterministic topology construction and inspection.
* `bfs.Components` gives weak component discovery without hand-written map iteration.
* The cyclomatic number `|E| - |V| + components` exposes the single cycle in `a`.
* `matrix.NewAdjacencyMatrix` turns a selected subgraph into dense graph algebra.

## Quick start B: Hexagram - one weighted graph, many algorithmic views

The classic weighted Hexagram example is the compact demonstration of `lvlath` as a multi-package toolkit: BFS-style shells on an unweighted view, Dijkstra weighted routing, MST backbone extraction, and TSP preparation through a metric matrix.

```text
                               [A]
                              / | \
                  (C-H:9)   3/  |7 \4   (D-F:7)
        (B-G:7)         \   /   |   \   /         (E-G:9)
             [B]────3────[C]──5─┼────[D]────3────[E]
                \       / | \   |  /  | \       /
                6\    7/  | 5\  | /4  |  \6    /7
                  \   /   |   \ |/    |   \   /
                   [F]──3─┼────[G]──5─┼────[H]
                  /   \   |9  / | \   |8  /   \
                2/    6\  |  /4 |  \6 |  /5    \6
                /       \ | /   |   \ | /       \
             [I]────5────[J]──8─┼────[K]────1────[L]
        (I-G:8)         /   \   |8  /   \          (L-G:7)
                  (J-H:7)   2\  |  /3   (K-F:8)
                              \ | /
                               [M]
```

Use this kind of graph when you want one fixture that is complex enough for real algorithms but still small enough to reason about visually.

	}

	edges := []struct {

		{"L", "G", 7},
		{"M", "G", 8},
	}
	for _, e := range edges {
		_, _ = g.AddEdge(e.u, e.v, e.w)
	}

	// BFS is unweighted by contract, so create an unweighted topology view.
	unweighted := core.UnweightedView(g)
	bfsResult, err := bfs.BFS(unweighted, "A")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)

	}

	oneHop := make([]string, 0)
	for id, depth := range bfsResult.Depth {
		if depth == 1 {
			oneHop = append(oneHop, id)
		}
	}
	sort.Strings(oneHop)
	fmt.Println("one-hop-from-A:", oneHop)

	// Dijkstra answers cost-sensitive routing.
	d, err := dijkstra.Dijkstra(g, "I", dijkstra.WithPathTracking())
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	distL, _ := d.DistanceTo("L")
	pathL, _ := d.PathTo("L")
	fmt.Println("I-to-L-cost:", distL)
	fmt.Println("I-to-L-path:", pathL)

	// MST gives the cheapest connected backbone.
	mstResult, err := mst.Kruskal(g)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println("mst-weight:", mstResult.TotalWeight)

	// Matrix metric closure prepares an all-pairs distance surface for routing or TSP.
	opts, err := matrix.NewMatrixOptions(matrix.WithUndirected(), matrix.WithWeighted())
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	closure, err := matrix.BuildMetricClosure(g, opts)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	_ = closure
	_ = context.Background()
}
```

## Quick start C: weighted service network - routing + flow + matrix policy

This is the practical infrastructure example: a directed weighted network where edge weights can represent latency/cost for routing, and another capacity graph can represent throughput for flow analysis.

```text
Weighted service graph for routing and matrix analysis:

 [edge] ────2────▶ [auth] ──1──▶ [profile] ──2──▶ [db]
    │                │             ▲              │
    │3               │4            │              │0  real zero-weight replication
    ▼                ▼             │              ▼
  [api] ───4────▶ [search] ───2────┘           [backup]
    │                │                            ▲
    │2               │3                           │1

 [cache] ◀──1──── [index] ────────5───────▶ [archive]

Key checks:
  - Dijkstra: cheapest route from edge to db.
  - Matrix: preserve zero-weight db -> backup.
  - Metric closure: publish all-pairs shortest distances.
  - Flow: compute capacity from ingress to storage tier on a related network.

## Design notes

### Determinism

Determinism is not “sort something at the end.” It is a cross-package contract.

* `core` owns deterministic graph surfaces: vertices, edges, neighbors.
* `bfs` preserves neighbor order and defines observable traversal state through result fields.
* `dfs` defines returned `Order` as finish order and publishes deterministic cycle witnesses.
* `dijkstra` uses deterministic frontier behavior and strict-improvement updates so equal-cost alternatives do not randomly overwrite witnesses.
* `mst` snapshots graph data, Kruskal stable-sorts finite edges, and Prim orders heap candidates by finite weight plus edge identity.
* `flow` builds and consumes residual state through deterministic algorithm policy.
* `matrix` uses fixed row-major loops and deterministic graph-adapter publication.
* `dtw` runs row-major DP and backtracks ties as diagonal, then vertical/up, then horizontal/left.
* `tsp` uses matrix order, deterministic solver tie-breaks, explicit seed-governed local search, and result fields that report exactness, timeout, and approximation status.
* `builder` and `gridgraph` produce reproducible input topologies instead of hiding randomness inside examples.

The purpose is practical: stable examples, golden tests, CI logs, witness paths, component roots, DP paths, MST edges, tours, and failure classes.


### Error handling

Prefer:

```go
if errors.Is(err, dijkstra.ErrTargetNotFound) {
	// unknown target: not the same as known but unreachable
}
```

Avoid:

```go
if strings.Contains(err.Error(), "target") {
	// brittle and not part of the public contract
}
```

### Weighted vs unweighted algorithms

Do not choose by package popularity. Choose by mathematical objective.

```text
Question                                      Correct primitive
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fewest edges / hop layers?                    bfs
Deep traversal / finish order / cycles?       dfs
Cheapest non-negative route from one source?  dijkstra
Cheapest acyclic connected backbone?          mst
Maximum feasible throughput?                  flow
All-pairs shortest distances?                 matrix.BuildMetricClosure
Dense topology/statistics/spectral features?  matrix
Temporal alignment with phase drift?          dtw
Closed tour through every vertex?             tsp
Generated lattice topology?                   gridgraph
Repeatable benchmark/test fixtures?           builder
```

Important distinctions:

* BFS minimizes edge count, not cost.
* Dijkstra minimizes non-negative path cost, not throughput.
* MST minimizes selected backbone cost, not route distance.
* Flow maximizes capacity, not shortest path.
* Metric closure creates a distance artifact, not original graph topology.
* DTW aligns time-warped sequences, not graph routes.
* TSP solves a closed tour over a complete finite cost model, not sparse reachability.

---

### Matrix semantics

`matrix` intentionally does not pretend that every dense numeric array means the same thing.

```text
normal adjacency:       0 can mean “no edge”
zero-preserving mode:   finite 0 can mean “real zero-cost edge”; +Inf means absence
metric closure:         cell means shortest-path distance, not an original edge
incidence matrix:       columns are edge identities, not vertex-pair weights
```

### Concurrency

`core` is thread-safe for graph storage and controlled mutation. Algorithm packages should be run against topology that is stable for the duration of the call unless the package explicitly documents otherwise. `matrix.Dense` does not contain locks; concurrent writes require external synchronization.

---

## Choosing the right package

|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Map-order flakiness in examples/tests                | `core` deterministic surfaces and package tie-break laws.                                             |
| Invalid topology reaches algorithms                  | Graph capability validation and package-level input validators.                                       |
| BFS used for weighted routing                        | Separate BFS hop semantics from Dijkstra weighted semantics.                                          |
| DFS order misread as discovery order                 | DFS `Result.Order` is documented finish order.                                                        |
| Unknown target treated as unreachable                | Dijkstra keeps target-domain errors separate from `+Inf` distances.                                   |
| Runtime route policy deletes graph structure         | Dijkstra thresholds/cutoffs model the run without mutating topology.                                  |
| Disconnected MST silently becomes forest             | `mst.WithForest` is explicit; strict MST returns disconnection.                                       |
| Non-finite MST weights corrupt sorting/heap behavior | MST rejects `NaN`, `+Inf`, `-Inf` before kernel execution.                                            |
| Flow output hides residual state                     | Flow result includes residual-network semantics.                                                      |
| DTW path requested from rolling memory               | DTW memory/path policy is explicit; path needs full accumulated storage.                              |
| DTW over-warps a signal                              | Use window and slope penalty deliberately.                                                            |
| Feature scale dominates multivariate DTW             | Normalize before `dtw.AlignMatrix`; it uses squared L2 row cost.                                      |
| Zero-weight edge disappears in matrix adjacency      | Use zero-preserving matrix policy; absence becomes `+Inf`.                                            |
| Metric closure exported as fake topology             | Matrix refuses metric-closure export as ordinary graph topology.                                      |
| TSP receives sparse unresolved `+Inf` matrix         | Use metric closure only when indirect travel is domain-valid; final kernels need finite completeness. |
| Christofides ratio claimed with greedy matching      | `tsp.BlossomMatch` is required for the formal `1.5` ratio.                                            |
| Branch-and-Bound timeout is mistaken for optimality  | Inspect TSP `Result.TimedOut` and TSP `Result.Optimal`.                                               |
| Local-search TSP treated as proof                    | 2-opt/3-opt improve tours; they do not certify global optimum.                                        |
| Randomized tests/benchmarks drift                    | Use fixed seeds or deterministic `builder` fixtures.                                                  |
| Docs describe fictional APIs                         | `{package}/doc.go`, `docs/{PACKAGE}.md`, examples, and tests must stay synchronized.                  |

## Documentation and contribution workflow

Documentation quality is part of the project standard. A package is considered mature when it has:

1. `{package}/doc.go` with implemented API, options, errors, and complexity.
2. `docs/{PACKAGE}.md` with math, proofs/invariants, pseudocode, diagrams, examples, and pitfalls.
3. Scenario-driven examples in `examples/` or `example_test.go`.
4. Validation, medium, and special tests.
5. Benchmarks where performance matters.
6. CI passing: `go test`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint`.

For contribution rules, branch flow, tests, linting, and coverage expectations, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
