# 8. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

> **Package:** `lvlath/dtw` | **Focus:** deterministic temporal alignment, numeric discipline, matrix-backed cost surfaces, result ownership

`lvlath/dtw` is the deterministic alignment kernel for ordered signals that share a structural pattern but do not move through time at the same pace. It is built for production use cases where a caller must understand not only the final distance, but also whether an admissible path exists, which phases stretched, which policy walls were active, and which diagnostic matrices were intentionally published.

The package is not a generic “compare two slices” snippet. It is a contract-driven Dynamic Time Warping implementation with explicit validation, sentinel-classified failures, stable path selection, and matrix-backed integration for multivariate time-series pipelines.

---

## 8.1. Header & Opening

`lvlath/dtw` exposes three canonical facades and one legacy wrapper:

- `Align` compares scalar `[]float64` sequences.
- `AlignCostMatrix` compares a caller-provided finite non-negative local-cost matrix.
- `AlignMatrix` compares multivariate time series stored as `matrix.Matrix`, with rows as time steps and columns as features.
- `DTW` preserves the old tuple-returning API and delegates to the same scalar recurrence.

All canonical facades return `*Result`, a detached artifact that records accumulated distance, reachability under policy, path-tracking state, effective options, and optional matrix surfaces.

A correct DTW consumer should ask four questions: did validation pass, is the final endpoint reachable, was the path requested and published, and are matrix artifacts needed for explanation or downstream analysis?

---

## 8.2. What & Why: The Laws of DTW

### The Five Laws of `lvlath/dtw`

1. **Determinism Law**

   The forward dynamic-programming loop is row-major: `i` ascending, then `j` ascending. Matrix local costs are materialized in row-major order. Backtracking uses a fixed predecessor tie-break: diagonal, then vertical/up, then horizontal/left. Equal-cost alignments therefore publish one stable representative optimal path.

2. **Numeric Discipline Law**

   Scalar samples are finite by default. Matrix inputs for `AlignMatrix` must pass finite validation. Local costs must always be finite and non-negative. `+Inf` is reserved for unreachable accumulated DP states and no-path results. `NaN` is never valid.

3. **Policy-Gated Warping Law**

   `WithWindow(-1)` disables the Sakoe-Chiba band. `WithWindow(0)` enforces strict diagonal alignment. `WithWindow(w)` for `w > 0` admits only cells satisfying `|i-j| <= w`. `WithSlopePenalty(p)` adds finite non-negative cost to vertical and horizontal steps.

4. **Result Ownership Law**

   Canonical facades return a `Result` artifact. Returned paths and matrices are detached and caller-owned. `PathOrError` distinguishes nil result, unreachable result, and path-not-tracked state. `Clone` copies result artifacts for independent downstream mutation.

5. **Sentinel-First Error Law**

   Callers classify failures with `errors.Is`. The package uses sentinel errors such as `ErrNilInput`, `ErrEmptyInput`, `ErrNaNInf`, `ErrNegativeCost`, `ErrInvalidWindow`, `ErrInvalidPenalty`, `ErrNoPath`, and `ErrPathNotTracked`. Matrix-backed adapters preserve relevant matrix errors through wrapping or joining.

---

## 8.3. Domain Scope & Non-Goals

### 8.3.1. What the Package Solves

`lvlath/dtw` solves deterministic alignment for scalar signals, externally computed local-cost surfaces, and multivariate time series. It computes accumulated DTW distance, reachability under policy, one deterministic optimal path when requested, optional accumulated-cost matrix, and optional local-cost matrix.

### 8.3.2. What the Package Does Not Do

The package intentionally does not provide automatic normalization, smoothing, resampling, interpolation, imputation, streaming DTW, approximate DTW, all-pairs batch DTW, exhaustive optimal-path enumeration, classifier calibration, probability-to-cost conversion, hidden feature weighting, snapshot isolation for caller-owned inputs, concurrent mutation support, metric guarantees, or `O(1)` exact DTW memory.

`AlignMatrix` uses squared L2 row distance. It does not normalize columns and does not take square roots. Feature scaling is caller responsibility.

---

## 8.4. Mathematical Formulation

### 8.4.1. Path Model

For inputs of lengths `n` and `m`, a DTW path is a monotone sequence of zero-based output coordinates:

$$ P = \big((i_0,j_0),(i_1,j_1),\ldots,(i_k,j_k)\big) $$

For a reachable published path, the endpoint law is:

$$ (i_0,j_0) = (0,0), \qquad (i_k,j_k) = (n-1,m-1) $$

Every step consumes one or both sequences:

$$ (i_{t+1}-i_t,\;j_{t+1}-j_t) \in \{(1,1),(1,0),(0,1)\} $$

A diagonal step consumes both sequences together. A vertical or horizontal step represents temporal stretching.

### 8.4.2. Accumulated DP Matrix

The implementation uses a prefix DP matrix with one extra row and one extra column:

$$ D \in \mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)} $$

Boundary conditions:

$$ D(0,0)=0 $$

$$ D(i,0)=+\infty \quad \text{for } i>0 $$

$$ D(0,j)=+\infty \quad \text{for } j>0 $$

For ordinary cells:

$$ D(i,j)=c(i,j)+\min\Big(D(i-1,j-1),\;D(i-1,j)+p,\;D(i,j-1)+p\Big) $$

where `c(i,j)` is the local alignment cost and `p` is `SlopePenalty`.

### 8.4.3. Objective Function

For a path `P`, the accumulated path cost is:

$$ Cost(P)=\sum_{(i,j)\in P} c(i,j) + p\cdot H(P) $$

where `H(P)` is the number of non-diagonal moves:

$$ H(P)=\left|\{t \mid (i_{t+1}-i_t,\;j_{t+1}-j_t)\in\{(1,0),(0,1)\}\}\right| $$

The DTW distance is:

$$ DTW(a,b)=\min_{P\in\mathcal{P}_{n,m,w}} Cost(P) $$

where `\mathcal{P}_{n,m,w}` is the set of monotone endpoint-valid paths admitted by the active window policy.

### 8.4.4. Cost Laws

For scalar `Align`, the default local cost is:

$$ c(i,j)=|a_{i-1}-b_{j-1}| $$

`WithSquaredCost` changes scalar local cost to:

$$ c(i,j)=(a_{i-1}-b_{j-1})^2 $$

For `AlignCostMatrix`, the caller supplies the local-cost surface directly:

$$ c(i,j)=C_{i-1,j-1} $$

For `AlignMatrix`, rows are time steps and columns are features. The local cost is squared L2 row distance:

$$ c(i,j)=\left\|X_{i-1}-Y_{j-1}\right\|_2^2 $$

Expanded over feature dimension `d`:

$$ c(i,j)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{d}\left(X_{i-1,\ell}-Y_{j-1,\ell}\right)^2 $$

The matrix-backed construction can be understood as:

$$ C_{ij}=\|X_i\|_2^2+\|Y_j\|_2^2-2X_iY_j^\top $$

### 8.4.5. Window Policy

The admissible cell domain is:

$$ A_w=\{(i,j)\mid 1\le i\le n,\;1\le j\le m,\;w=-1\;\lor\;|i-j|\le w\} $$

Cells outside `A_w` are not usable predecessor targets and are published as `+Inf` in accumulated state when the matrix is stored.

Important implementation note: the current kernels still scan the rectangular DP grid. The window restricts admissible states and skips scalar local-cost evaluation outside the band, but the worst-case loop structure remains `O(n*m)`. For `AlignMatrix`, local-cost construction occurs before window gating.

### 8.4.6. Complexity by Phase

Let `n` be first length or row count, `m` be second length or row count, `d` be feature dimension for `AlignMatrix`, `k` be number of options, and `L` be returned path length.

| State                                     | Return shape                              | Meaning                                                                    | Caller action                                            |
|:------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Reachable distance, path not requested    | `Result`, `nil`                           | Alignment exists; distance is authoritative; path is intentionally absent. | Use `Distance`, `Reachable`, and policy fields.          |
| Reachable distance, path requested        | `Result`, `nil`                           | Alignment exists; path is authoritative.                                   | Use `Path` or `PathOrError`.                             |

## 8.6. Options, Numeric Policy & Error Law

### 8.6.1. Functional Options

```go
func WithWindow(w int) Option

func WithSlopePenalty(p float64) Option

func WithReturnPath(on bool) Option

func WithReturnAccumulated(on bool) Option

func WithReturnLocalCost(on bool) Option

func WithMemoryMode(mode MemoryMode) Option

func WithValidateFinite(on bool) Option

func WithCostFunc(fn CostFunc) Option

func WithAbsoluteCost() Option

func WithSquaredCost() Option
```

Options are runtime policies. They do not mutate input slices or input matrices. They shape admissibility, publication, and local scalar cost selection.

### 8.6.2. Numeric Policy

| Value           | Scalar input             | Local cost              | Accumulated DP state               |
|:----------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| finite float64  | allowed                  | allowed if non-negative | allowed                            |
| negative finite | allowed as scalar sample | rejected as local cost  | not expected from valid policy     |
| `NaN`           | rejected by default      | rejected                | never valid                        |
| `+Inf`          | rejected by default      | rejected                | valid only as unreachable sentinel |
| `-Inf`          | rejected by default      | rejected                | never valid                        |

`WithValidateFinite(false)` only disables scalar input finite checks. It does not allow invalid local costs and does not weaken matrix input validation for `AlignMatrix`.

### 8.6.3. Sentinel Errors

```go
var (
	ErrNilInput        = errors.New("dtw: nil input sequence")
	ErrEmptyInput      = errors.New("dtw: input sequences must be non-empty")
	ErrNilOptions      = errors.New("dtw: nil options")
	ErrNilOption       = errors.New("dtw: nil option")
	ErrBadInput        = errors.New("dtw: invalid input")
	ErrInvalidWindow   = errors.New("dtw: invalid window")
	ErrInvalidPenalty  = errors.New("dtw: invalid slope penalty")
	ErrNaNInf          = errors.New("dtw: NaN or Inf encountered")
	ErrNoPath          = errors.New("dtw: no admissible warping path")
	ErrPathNeedsMatrix = errors.New("dtw: path tracking requires FullMatrix")
	ErrPathNotTracked  = errors.New("dtw: path was not tracked")
	ErrIncompletePath  = errors.New("dtw: path computation incomplete")
	ErrNilResult       = errors.New("dtw: nil result")
	ErrNilCostFunc     = errors.New("dtw: nil cost function")
	ErrNegativeCost    = errors.New("dtw: negative local cost")
)
```

Rules:

- Use `errors.Is`.
- Do not parse error strings.
- Option failures occur before DP state allocation.
- Matrix-backed adapters preserve relevant matrix-layer errors.
- User errors returned by custom `CostFunc` are propagated.

## 8.7. Algorithmic Architecture & Pseudocode

### 8.7.1. Kernel Model

The package has two DP entry families:

1. scalar kernel: validates scalar slices and computes local scalar cost inside the DP loop;
2. flat local-cost kernel: consumes a row-major local-cost slice and is used by `AlignCostMatrix` and `AlignMatrix`.

Both kernels share the same recurrence, boundary law, window law, no-path classification, and backtracking tie-break.

### 8.7.2. Canonical Execution Stages

```text
STAGE 1: Option Assembly
  apply user options
  reject nil options
  validate window, penalty, memory mode, callback policy
  derive FullMatrix storage when path or accumulated matrix is requested

STAGE 2: Input / Adapter Validation
  scalar Align:
    reject nil or empty input slices
    reject NaN and ±Inf samples by default

  AlignCostMatrix:
    reject nil matrix
    reject zero rows or zero columns
    reject NaN, ±Inf, and negative local costs
    materialize row-major costs

  AlignMatrix:
    reject nil matrices
    reject empty time axes
    reject feature-dimension mismatch
    reject non-finite matrix input
    construct squared-L2 local-cost matrix

STAGE 3: State Initialization
  allocate rolling rows
  set D(0,0)=0
  set prefix row/column to +Inf
  allocate accumulated matrix only when needed
  allocate local-cost artifact only when requested

STAGE 4: DP Recurrence
  scan rows in ascending order
  scan columns in ascending order
  apply window wall
  compute or read local cost
  choose stable minimum predecessor
  publish accumulated/local-cost cells when requested

STAGE 5: Final Classification
  read final distance from D(n,m)
  create Result with policy fields
  if final distance is +Inf:
    publish unreachable result
    return ErrNoPath only if path tracking was requested

STAGE 6: Backtracking and Publication
  if path requested and reachable:
    backtrack from D(n,m)
    apply tie-break diagonal -> up -> left
    reverse path
    publish Result
```

### 8.7.3. Scalar Kernel Pseudocode

```text
FUNCTION Align(a, b, options):
  cfg = applyOptions(options)
  IF cfg invalid:
    RETURN nil, error

  RETURN compute(a, b, cfg)
```

```text
FUNCTION compute(a, b, cfg):
  IF a == nil OR b == nil:
    RETURN nil, ErrNilInput

  IF len(a) == 0 OR len(b) == 0:
    RETURN nil, ErrEmptyInput

  IF cfg.validateFinite:
    REJECT NaN and ±Inf samples

  n = len(a)
  m = len(b)
  prevRow = make(m + 1)
  currRow = make(m + 1)

  prevRow[0] = 0
  FOR j = 1..m:
    prevRow[j] = +Inf

  IF full accumulated storage is required:
    accumulated = Dense(n+1, m+1)
    fill accumulated with +Inf
    accumulated[0,0] = 0

  IF local-cost artifact requested:
    localCost = Dense(n, m)

  FOR i = 1..n:
    currRow[0] = +Inf

    FOR j = 1..m:
      IF cfg.window >= 0 AND abs(i-j) > cfg.window:
        currRow[j] = +Inf
        IF accumulated exists:
          accumulated[i,j] = +Inf
        CONTINUE

      local = cfg.costFunc(a[i-1], b[j-1])

Legend:
  ●  = selected path cell
  ○  = admissible non-path cell
  ## = blocked by window policy
  ━  = repeated-template or repeated-observed phase on the selected path

Interpretation:
  R02 aligns to both L02 and L03: the live accumulation phase is slower.
  R07 aligns to L08 and L09: the peak/cooling phase is stretched.
  R12 aligns to L14 and L15: the pullback lingers.

## 8.9. Go Example Scenarios

These examples use deterministic production-style data. Each example follows the same pipeline: build input data, check construction errors, execute DTW, check algorithm errors, and consume `Result`.

### 8.9.1. Crypto OHLC Breakout Pattern Matching

This scenario compares a 12-candle reference breakout against a 15-candle live window. Each row is an OHLC vector. The path reveals where the live market stretched the template.

### 8.9.2. Voice Command Alignment over Acoustic Cost Surface

This scenario uses `AlignCostMatrix` because an upstream acoustic model already computed frame-to-frame costs. DTW consumes the cost surface directly and explains the stretched pronunciation.

### 8.9.3. Multivariate Vibration Signature Matching

This scenario compares a healthy spindle-impact reference signature with an observed signature containing an extra rise and peak frame.

```go
package main

## 8.10. Laws of Ownership, Concurrency & Partial Results

### 8.10.1. Ownership Law

`Result` is a detached artifact.

- `Result.Path` is caller-owned.
- `PathOrError` returns a copy of the path.
- `Result.Clone` copies path and Dense matrix artifacts.
- `Result.Accumulated` and `Result.LocalCost` are result-owned artifacts when present.
- Input slices and matrices are never mutated by the package.

### 8.10.2. Matrix Artifact Law

`Result.Accumulated` is the DP surface `D`. It is useful for heatmaps, debugging, path explanation, and predecessor inspection.

`Result.LocalCost` is the local cost surface `C`. It is useful for checking feature scale, acoustic model behavior, embedding distances, and externally supplied cost surfaces.

Returned matrix artifacts are not live views into caller input.

### 8.10.3. Concurrency Law

The package is pure over caller-provided immutable inputs.

Concurrent independent calls are safe when each call receives inputs that are not mutated during execution. Concurrent mutation of input slices or matrices during `Align`, `AlignCostMatrix`, or `AlignMatrix` is unsupported and voids reproducibility.

Returned `Result` values are not internally synchronized. If callers mutate returned paths or matrices across goroutines, they must provide their own synchronization.

### 8.10.4. Partial-Result Law

Validation and option failures return `nil` result plus error. This prevents callers from accidentally consuming corrupted or uninitialized state.

No-path is different: it is a mathematically meaningful domain state. When the final cell is unreachable and path tracking is not requested, the package returns `Result{Distance:+Inf, Reachable:false}` with `nil` error. When path tracking is requested, the package returns the same unreachable result with `ErrNoPath`.

Backtracking failures such as `ErrIncompletePath` indicate that a finite forward DP state could not be reconstructed into a valid path. Callers must treat such results as failed executions and must not use `Path`.

### 8.10.5. Legacy Wrapper Law

`DTW(a, b, nil)` uses default legacy options and does not panic. Legacy `ReturnPath=true` requires `MemoryMode == FullMatrix`; otherwise `ErrPathNeedsMatrix` is returned. New APIs should use `Align` and `Result`.

---

## 8.11. Pitfalls & Best Practices

### 8.11.1. Anti-Patterns

> **Do not treat `Window=0` as unconstrained.** It is strict diagonal alignment. Use `Window=-1` for no band.

> **Do not parse error strings.** Use `errors.Is`.

> **Do not request a path from rolling rows in the legacy API.** Path reconstruction needs accumulated state.

> **Do not pass probabilities directly as costs unless that scale is intentional.** Convert probability-like values outside DTW when needed.

> **Do not allow invalid local costs.** NaN, Inf, and negative costs are rejected.

> **Do not assume DTW distance is a metric.** DTW generally does not guarantee triangle inequality.

> **Do not rely on hidden normalization.** `AlignMatrix` does not normalize features.

> **Do not expect all optimal paths.** The package returns one deterministic representative optimal path.

> **Do not mutate input matrices while alignment is running.** The package does not snapshot caller-owned mutable inputs.

> **Do not document `NoMemory` as `O(1)` exact DTW.** It is a deprecated compatibility alias for rolling-row distance mode.

### 8.11.2. Best Practices

> **Choose the correct facade.** Use `Align` for scalar signals, `AlignCostMatrix` for external cost surfaces, and `AlignMatrix` for row-wise multivariate time series.

> **Tune window before penalty.** A window defines admissibility. A penalty prices stretching inside that admissible domain.

> **Use small positive slope penalties for real sensors and speech.** This keeps repeated frames possible but visible in the score.

> **Request expensive artifacts intentionally.** Path, accumulated matrix, and local matrix artifacts increase memory use.

> **Inspect path anchors.** Repeated `I` or `J` values identify the phases that stretched.

> **Normalize before `AlignMatrix` when units differ.** Feature scale directly affects squared L2 costs.

> **Use `PathOrError` in reusable code.** It separates nil result, no path, and path-not-tracked states.

> **Clone before independent mutation.** Use `Result.Clone` when multiple consumers will mutate artifacts independently.

> **Treat `Reachable=false` as a policy outcome.** It usually means the window/domain policy blocked the endpoint.

> **Keep custom `CostFunc` deterministic and cheap.** It runs inside the DP loop and participates directly in reproducibility and runtime.
