# 6. Minimum Spanning Trees and Forests

> **Package:** `lvlath/mst` | **Focus:** Deterministic MST/MSF Kernels, Strict Graph Policy, Sentinel-First Errors, Detached Results

The `lvlath/mst` package is a deterministic, contract-driven minimum-spanning connectivity kernel for `core.Graph`. It is not a casual graph snippet, not a topology mutator, and not a hidden fallback layer for disconnected systems. It validates graph semantics, assembles explicit runtime policy, snapshots candidate edges into detached storage, applies a precise greedy kernel, and publishes a canonical `Result` artifact.

The package answers one foundational question:

> What is the minimum finite-cost acyclic backbone that connects every vertex, or each connected component when explicit forest mode is requested?

Two greedy kernels are exposed under one shared contract:

- `Kruskal`: global finite-weight ordering plus disjoint-set component merging.
- `Prim`: root-driven frontier expansion through a deterministic edge heap.

Both algorithms obey the same graph-policy law, numeric law, endpoint law, ownership law, and partial-result law.

---

## 6.1. What & Why: The Laws of `mst`

Minimum spanning tree computation is a graph-theoretic compression tool: it removes every unnecessary cycle while preserving connectivity with the least possible total finite edge cost. This makes it valuable in domains where each retained edge means money, latency, metal area, risk, power loss, or operational complexity.

### 6.1.1. Why MST matters

1. **Network design**
    - MST provides the cheapest connected backbone before redundancy, bandwidth, or reliability overlays are added.
    - Examples: fiber backbones, microwave relays, satellite control links, campus cabling, data-center interconnects, sensor networks, and emergency response grids.

2. **VLSI and physical design**
    - MST is a deterministic baseline for pin connection, global-routing sketches, net clustering, clock-tree preplanning, and channel reservation before Steiner-tree or timing-aware refinement.
    - It is not final sign-off routing, but it is a stable mathematical backbone for the first pass.

3. **Smart grid and green energy systems**
    - MST helps identify minimum-cost connectivity between substations, batteries, renewable generators, and critical loads.
    - Explicit forest mode represents islanded microgrids honestly instead of hiding disconnection.

4. **Big data and machine learning**
    - MST is a standard primitive for clustering, graph-based segmentation, similarity backbones, outlier analysis, and “cut the heaviest selected bridges” pipelines.

5. **Algorithmic subroutines**
    - MST appears in approximation algorithms, graph sparsification, partitioning, topology simplification, and as a diagnostic baseline for more constrained optimization problems.

### 6.1.2. The Six Laws of `mst`

#### Law 1: Graph-Semantics Fidelity

The package computes MST/MSF only over weighted, undirected graph semantics.

It rejects:
- nil graph input,
- unweighted graph policy,
- directed graph policy,
- directed edge-level overrides,
- empty graph input for tree publication.

Self-loops are ignored because they cannot connect two components. Parallel edges are preserved as independent candidates because the lighter useful representative may be part of the optimum.

#### Law 2: Determinism

The same graph and the same option list produce the same result.

Determinism comes from the composition of these implementation decisions:
- options are applied in caller-provided order,
- vertices are read from `core.Vertices()`,
- edges are read from `core.Edges()`,
- snapshot storage contains detached `core.Edge` values,
- Kruskal uses stable sort by finite `Weight`,
- equal-weight Kruskal candidates keep snapshot edge order,
- Prim heap ordering uses finite `Weight`, then unique `Edge.ID`,
- component roots are normalized into deterministic public roots.

No public output may depend on Go map iteration order.

#### Law 3: Numeric Discipline

Weights are `float64`, but only finite values are valid.

Accepted:
- finite negative weights,
- finite zero weights,
- finite positive weights.

Rejected:
- `NaN`,
- `+Inf`,
- `-Inf`.

The package does not treat infinity as a wall, shortcut, disconnected marker, unknown value, or unreachable relation. Non-finite values are rejected before sorting or heap operations.

#### Law 4: Endpoint Resolution

Undirected edges are mirrored into both endpoint adjacency lists. Prim must resolve the opposite endpoint relative to the current source vertex.

The forbidden shortcut is:
```text
next = edge.To
```

The correct law is:
```text
if source == edge.From: next = edge.To
if source == edge.To:   next = edge.From
```

This is required for roots that start at the stored `To` endpoint of an undirected edge.

#### Law 5: Result Ownership

`Result` is the canonical result artifact.

It stores detached `core.Edge` values and does not retain live `*core.Edge` pointers into `core.Graph`. Callers can clone, serialize, reorder copies, or consume metadata without mutating the source graph.

#### Law 6: Partial-Result Suppression

On validation failure or strict-tree kernel failure, the package returns:
```go
nil, err
```

It does not publish partial trees. A disconnected strict-tree attempt is not a smaller successful MST; it is `ErrDisconnected`. A forest is published only when the caller explicitly requests `WithForest()`.

---

## 6.2. Domain Scope & Non-Goals

### 6.2.1. What the package solves

The package solves these problems:
1. strict MST over a connected weighted undirected `*core.Graph`,
2. explicit MSF over disconnected weighted undirected `*core.Graph`,
3. deterministic Kruskal selection through global candidate ordering and DSU merging,
4. deterministic Prim selection through root-based frontier expansion,
5. detached result publication through `Result`.

### 6.2.2. Supported graph model

The input graph must satisfy:
- `graph != nil`,
- `graph.Weighted() == true`,
- `graph.Directed() == false`,
- `graph.HasDirectedEdges() == false`,
- every candidate edge weight is finite,
- graph topology remains stable during snapshot construction.

### 6.2.3. Non-goals

The package does not implement:
- directed optimum branching,
- directed arborescence,
- shortest paths,
- all-pairs routing,
- Steiner tree optimization,
- dynamic MST maintenance,
- capacity-constrained MST,
- reliability-constrained redundant design,
- epsilon-based ordering,
- infinite-weight wall semantics,
- partial-result publication,
- concurrent mutation safety during execution,
- matrix-specific APIs unless those exact APIs exist in source code.

If a workflow needs directed reachability, dependency ordering, route distance, or a graph with one-way semantics, this package is not the correct abstraction.

### 6.2.4. Snapshot boundary

The adapter reads vertices and edges before the kernel starts and stores detached edge values. This protects the algorithm from later edge-value aliasing in the result, but it is not an isolation transaction against concurrent writers.

Concurrent mutation during snapshot construction is unsupported and voids correctness.

---

## 6.3. Mathematical Formulation

### 6.3.1. Graph and weight model

Let:
$$ G = (V, E, w) $$
where:
$$ V = \text{finite vertex set} $$
$$ E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V, u \ne v\} $$
$$ w : E \to \mathbb{R} $$

The runtime requires every `w(e)` to be finite:
$$ \forall e \in E: w(e) \in \mathbb{R},\quad w(e) \ne \mathrm{NaN},\quad w(e) \ne +\infty,\quad w(e) \ne -\infty $$

Negative finite weights are valid. MST optimality does not require non-negative weights; it requires a finite total ordering over candidate edges.

### 6.3.2. Strict MST objective

A strict spanning tree `T` must satisfy:
$$ T \subseteq E $$
$$ (V,T) \text{ is connected} $$
$$ (V,T) \text{ is acyclic} $$
$$ |T| = |V| - 1 $$

The objective is:
$$ \operatorname{MST}(G) = \arg\min_{T \subseteq E}\;\sum_{e \in T} w(e) $$

subject to:
$$ T \text{ spans } V \quad \land \quad T \text{ is acyclic} \quad \land \quad |T| = |V| - 1 $$

CodeCogs view:
$$ \operatorname{MST}(G)=\arg\min_{T\subseteq E}\sum_{e\in T}w(e),\quad |T|=|V|-1 $$

### 6.3.3. Minimum spanning forest objective

For a disconnected graph with connected components:
$$ \mathcal{C}(G)=\{C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k\} $$

explicit forest mode publishes:
$$ \operatorname{MSF}(G)=\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}\operatorname{MST}(C_i) $$

The result cardinality law is:
$$ |E_{result}| = |V| - k $$
and:
$$ \texttt{ComponentCount} = k $$

Forest mode is a different publication domain, not a fallback after strict MST fails.

### 6.3.4. Cut and cycle properties

The correctness of Kruskal and Prim is based on two classical greedy laws.

**Cut property:** for any non-empty proper subset `S ⊂ V`, if `e` is a minimum-weight edge crossing the cut `(S, V \ S)`, then `e` belongs to at least one MST.

$$ \delta(S)=\{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in S,\;v\in V\setminus S\} $$
$$ e \in \arg\min_{x\in\delta(S)}w(x) \Rightarrow e \text{ is safe for some MST} $$

**Cycle property:** for any cycle, a strictly heaviest edge on that cycle cannot belong to any MST.

$$ e \in C \land w(e) > w(x)\;\forall x\in C\setminus\{e\}\Rightarrow e \notin \operatorname{MST}(G) $$

When equal weights exist, multiple MST representatives may be valid. Determinism chooses a stable representative; it does not change the optimality proof.

### 6.3.5. Kruskal update law

Kruskal maintains a DSU partition `P` of vertices.

For a candidate edge `e=(u,v)` in sorted finite-weight order:
$$ \operatorname{Accept}(e) \iff \operatorname{Find}(u) \ne \operatorname{Find}(v) $$

If accepted:
$$ P \leftarrow \operatorname{Union}(P,u,v) $$
and:
$$ T \leftarrow T \cup \{e\} $$

Every accepted edge reduces the number of DSU components by one. Every rejected edge would form a cycle.

### 6.3.6. Prim frontier update law

Prim maintains a visited set `S` and a frontier heap of edges crossing from visited to unvisited vertices.

At each step:
$$ e^* = \arg\min_{e\in\delta(S)}(w(e), id(e)) $$
where `id(e)` is `Edge.ID` and is used only as a deterministic tie-breaker after finite weight.

Then:
$$ S \leftarrow S \cup \{target(e^*)\} $$
$$ T \leftarrow T \cup \{e^*\} $$

Endpoint resolution is source-relative:

$$
target(e,source)=
\begin{cases}
edge.To, & source=edge.From\\
edge.From, & source=edge.To
\end{cases}
$$

There are no runtime thresholds or cutoffs in the current source. The only admissibility gates are graph policy, finite numeric validation, root policy, and explicit strict-tree versus forest publication mode.

### 6.3.7. Complexity by phase

Let:
- `V = |vertices|`,
- `E = |non-loop candidate edges|`,
- `C = component count`,
- `k = number of options`,
- `α(V) = inverse Ackermann factor`.

| Phase            | Time                        | Space        | Notes                                                                                             |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Option assembly  | $$O(k)$$                    | $$O(1)$$     | Applies options in caller order and validates policy values.                                      |
| Snapshot adapter | $$O(V + E)$$                | $$O(V + E)$$ | Copies vertices, filters loops, mirrors adjacency, rejects invalid policy and non-finite weights. |
| Kruskal kernel   | $$O(E\log E + E\alpha(V))$$ | $$O(E + V)$$ | Stable sort plus DSU.                                                                             |
| Prim kernel      | $$O(E\log E)$$              | $$O(E + V)$$ | Edge-frontier heap; stale candidates may be discarded.                                            |
| Result clone     | $$O(E + C)$$                | $$O(E + C)$$ | Deep-copies selected edges and component roots.                                                   |
| EdgeValues       | $$O(E)$$                    | $$O(E)$$     | Returns caller-owned edge slice.                                                                  |

The current Prim implementation is an edge-frontier heap implementation. It must not be documented as `O(E log V)` unless the kernel changes to a vertex-key decrease-key design.

## 6.4. Public API & Result Contract

### 6.4.1. Public entry points

```go
func MinimumSpanningTree(graph *core.Graph, opts ...Option) (*Result, error)

func Kruskal(graph *core.Graph) (*Result, error)

func Prim(graph *core.Graph, root string) (*Result, error)
```

`MinimumSpanningTree` is the canonical facade. It assembles options, validates the graph through the snapshot adapter, dispatches to exactly one kernel, and returns `Result` on success.

`Kruskal` and `Prim` are focused wrappers over the facade. They do not contain independent algorithm logic.

### 6.4.2. Public policy types

```go
type Algorithm string

const (
    AlgorithmKruskal Algorithm = "kruskal"
    AlgorithmPrim    Algorithm = "prim"
)

type Mode string

const (
    ModeStrictTree Mode = "strict_tree"
    ModeForest     Mode = "forest"
)

type Option func(*Options) error

type Options struct {
    Algorithm Algorithm
    Mode      Mode
    Root      string
}
```

### 6.4.3. Public option helpers

```go
func DefaultOptions() Options

func ApplyOptions(user ...Option) (Options, error)

func WithAlgorithm(algorithm Algorithm) Option

func WithRoot(root string) Option

func WithForest() Option

func WithStrictTree() Option
```

### 6.4.4. Result artifact

```go
type Result struct {
    Algorithm Algorithm
    Mode      Mode
    Root      string

    Edges       []core.Edge
    TotalWeight float64

    VertexCount    int
    ComponentCount int
    ComponentRoots []string
}
```

Helper methods:

```go
func (r *Result) IsNil() bool
func (r *Result) Clone() *Result
func (r *Result) EdgeValues() ([]core.Edge, error)
```

### 6.4.5. Field contract

| Field            | Contract                                                    |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Algorithm`      | Algorithm selected by option assembly and dispatch.         |
| `Mode`           | Result publication mode: strict tree or explicit forest.    |
| `Root`           | Meaningful for Prim; empty for normal Kruskal strict calls. |
| `Edges`          | Detached selected `core.Edge` values.                       |
| `TotalWeight`    | Sum of selected edge weights.                               |
| `VertexCount`    | Number of vertices in the validated snapshot.               |
| `ComponentCount` | `1` for successful strict MST; `k` for forest mode.         |
| `ComponentRoots` | Deterministic public roots for result components.           |

### 6.4.6. Result-domain states

`mst` has no target vertex and does not expose path-style states such as “unknown target” or “known but unreachable”. Its states are MST/MSF publication states.

| State                    | Result               | Error                                      | Meaning                                         |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Valid strict tree        | non-nil `*Result` | nil                                        | Connected graph successfully spanned.           |
| Valid explicit forest    | non-nil `*Result` | nil                                        | Forest requested and published.                 |
| Invalid graph policy     | nil                  | sentinel error                             | Graph cannot enter MST snapshot domain.         |
| Missing Prim root        | nil                  | `ErrEmptyRoot` or `core.ErrVertexNotFound` | Prim root policy failed.                        |
| Disconnected strict tree | nil                  | `ErrDisconnected`                          | Strict tree cannot span all vertices.           |
| Nil result helper access | nil data             | `ErrNilResult`                             | Helper requiring result data was called on nil. |

### 6.4.7. Wrapper equivalence

```go
Kruskal(graph)
```

is equivalent to:

```go
MinimumSpanningTree(graph, WithAlgorithm(AlgorithmKruskal))
```

```go
Prim(graph, root)
```

is equivalent to:

```go
MinimumSpanningTree(graph, WithAlgorithm(AlgorithmPrim), WithRoot(root))
```

---

## 6.5. Options, Numeric Policy & Error Law

### 6.5.1. Option assembly law

`ApplyOptions` starts from:

```go
Options{
    Algorithm: AlgorithmKruskal,
    Mode:      ModeStrictTree,
    Root:      "",
}
```

Then every option is applied in caller-provided order.

The option model is last-writer-wins. `WithForest()` may be overridden later by `WithStrictTree()`. `WithAlgorithm()` may be supplied more than once; the last valid algorithm wins.

### 6.5.2. Option behavior

| Option                            | Effect                             | Failure                           |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| `WithAlgorithm(AlgorithmKruskal)` | Select Kruskal.                    | none                              |
| `WithAlgorithm(AlgorithmPrim)`    | Select Prim.                       | none                              |
| `WithAlgorithm(unknown)`          | Reject unsupported algorithm.      | `ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm`         |
| `WithRoot(root)`                  | Set explicit Prim root.            | `ErrEmptyRoot` when root is empty |
| `WithForest()`                    | Publish MSF instead of strict MST. | none                              |
| `WithStrictTree()`                | Restore strict MST publication.    | none                              |
| nil option                        | Invalid option value.              | `ErrNilOption`                    |

Prim strict tree mode requires a root during option assembly. Prim forest mode may omit root and grow components in deterministic vertex order.

### 6.5.3. Numeric policy

The numeric policy is finite-only:

$$ w(e) \in \mathbb{R}\quad\text{and}\quad w(e) \notin \{\mathrm{NaN}, +\infty, -\infty\} $$

There is no threshold option, no cutoff option, and no infinite-wall option in the current public API.

### 6.5.4. Comparator law

Kruskal candidate ordering:

```text
Primary key: finite Weight ascending
Tie law:     stable sort retains snapshot/core edge order
```

Prim candidate ordering:

```text
Primary key: finite Weight ascending
Tie law:     unique Edge.ID ascending
```

Epsilon comparisons are forbidden in sort and heap ordering because they can violate strict weak ordering.

### 6.5.5. Sentinel-first error law

Use `errors.Is`. Do not parse error strings.

Current sentinels:

```go
var ErrInvalidGraph error
var ErrNilGraph error
var ErrDirectedGraph error
var ErrDirectedEdge error
var ErrUnweightedGraph error
var ErrEmptyGraph error
var ErrDisconnected error
var ErrEmptyRoot error
var ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm error
var ErrInvalidOption error
var ErrNilOption error
var ErrNaNInfWeight error
var ErrNilResult error
```

Graph-policy errors may be joined:

```go
errors.Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrNilGraph)
errors.Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrUnweightedGraph)
errors.Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrDirectedGraph)
errors.Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrDirectedEdge)
errors.Join(ErrDisconnected, ErrEmptyGraph)
```

A non-empty Prim root absent from the validated snapshot is classified through `core.ErrVertexNotFound`.

### 6.5.6. Panic policy

Public validation is error-returning.

Nil option values return `ErrNilOption`. Nil result data access returns `ErrNilResult`. The package does not use panic-based validation for normal user errors.

### 6.6.2. Snapshot adapter model

The adapter validates graph policy and builds:

```go
type mstSnapshot struct {
    vertices []string
    edges    []core.Edge
    adj      map[string][]core.Edge
}
```

Snapshot laws:

- `vertices` is a detached copy of `core.Vertices()` output,
- `edges` stores detached non-loop candidate edges,
- `adj` stores undirected mirrored adjacency lists,
- every candidate edge is copied by value,
- no live `*core.Edge` pointer is retained.

### 6.6.3. Facade pseudocode

```text
FUNCTION MinimumSpanningTree(graph, opts...):
    cfg, err = ApplyOptions(opts...)
    IF err != nil:
        RETURN nil, err

    snapshot, err = newMSTSnapshot(graph)
    IF err != nil:
        RETURN nil, err

    SWITCH cfg.Algorithm:
        CASE AlgorithmKruskal:
            RETURN kruskalKernel(snapshot, cfg)
        CASE AlgorithmPrim:
            RETURN primKernel(snapshot, cfg)
        DEFAULT:
            RETURN nil, ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm
```

### 6.6.4. Snapshot pseudocode

```text
FUNCTION newMSTSnapshot(graph):
    IF graph == nil:
        RETURN nil, Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrNilGraph)

    IF graph.Weighted() == false:
        RETURN nil, Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrUnweightedGraph)

    IF graph.Directed() == true:
        RETURN nil, Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrDirectedGraph)

    IF graph.HasDirectedEdges() == true:
        RETURN nil, Join(ErrInvalidGraph, ErrDirectedEdge)

    vertices = graph.Vertices()
    IF len(vertices) == 0:
        RETURN nil, Join(ErrDisconnected, ErrEmptyGraph)

    snapshot.vertices = copy(vertices)
    snapshot.edges = empty edge-value list
    snapshot.adj = map vertex -> edge-value list

## 6.7. ASCII Diagrams

This section is intentionally diagram-heavy. Every non-trivial topology diagram uses explicit edge IDs and a complete edge catalog, so the drawing never forces readers to guess which channel connects which endpoints.

Diagram notation:

- `E##`, `F##`, `D##`, `U##`, and `K##` are edge IDs used only inside this document section.
- Edge labels in drawings are IDs, not weights.
- The edge catalog below each drawing is the authority for endpoints and weights.
- Box-drawing lines show visual structure; the catalog removes ambiguity.

### 6.7.1. VLSI global-routing candidate graph

This graph has ten blocks and eighteen candidate channels. It models a global-routing baseline: the MST is the minimum-cost acyclic skeleton that connects all blocks, not the final timing-aware, congestion-aware, or Steiner-optimized route.

Result interpretation:

```text
Strict MST law:
  VertexCount = 10
  len(Edges)  = 9

Kruskal:
  sort all E01..E18 by finite Weight,
  accept only edges that merge different DSU components.

Prim:
  start from Root,
  push incident candidate channels,
  repeatedly select the minimum frontier edge by (Weight, Edge.ID).
```

### 6.7.2. Strict MST versus explicit MSF publication

The following graph has three connected components. Strict tree mode must reject it because there is no spanning tree over all vertices. Forest mode must publish one tree per component.

### 6.7.4. Equal-cost determinism tie-break

Equal weights are mathematically valid. Public instability is not. This diagram uses a complete four-vertex graph where every edge has weight `1`; the chosen representative must still be reproducible.

Tie-break law:

```text
Kruskal:
  stable sort by Weight
  equal weights retain snapshot/core edge order

Prim:
  heap key = (Weight, Edge.ID)
  Edge.ID closes the tie because IDs are unique

Forbidden:
  epsilon comparator inside sort/heap
  map iteration as tie-break source
  source/target tie-break after unique Edge.ID
```

### 6.7.5. Endpoint Resolution Law

Undirected adjacency is mirrored. Prim must resolve the opposite endpoint relative to the current source. The stored edge direction fields are not traversal direction.

## 6.8. Go Example Scenarios

The examples below use production-style error checking for graph construction and algorithm execution. They are scenario-driven and intentionally use non-trivial graphs with 8 or more vertices.

### 6.8.1. VLSI global-routing baseline

The graph models candidate channels between chip blocks. MST gives a deterministic low-cost skeleton for later physical design passes.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/core"
    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/mst"
)

func main() {
    graph, _ := core.NewGraph(core.WithWeighted())
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("PLL", "NoC", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("NoC", "CPU", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("NoC", "GPU", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("NoC", "NPU", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("NoC", "SRAM", 2)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("CPU", "SRAM", 6)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("GPU", "SRAM", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("NPU", "SRAM", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("ISP", "NoC", 7)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("ISP", "GPU", 6)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("DDR", "PHY", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("PHY", "NoC", 8)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("DDR", "CPU", 9)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("PMIC", "PLL", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("PMIC", "PHY", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("PMIC", "NoC", 10)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("DDR", "SRAM", 7)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("ISP", "PHY", 8)

    result, err := mst.MinimumSpanningTree(graph)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("mst:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf(
        "algorithm=%s mode=%s blocks=%d wires=%d components=%d total=%.0f\n",
        result.Algorithm,
        result.Mode,
        result.VertexCount,
        len(result.Edges),
        result.ComponentCount,
        result.TotalWeight,
    )

    // Output:
    // algorithm=kruskal mode=strict_tree blocks=10 wires=9 components=1 total=34
}
```

### 6.8.2. Space-mesh minimum spanning forest

The graph models disconnected orbital communication groups. Strict MST would be false; explicit forest mode publishes one minimum tree per reachable mesh.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/core"
    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/mst"
)

func main() {
    graph, err := core.NewGraph(core.WithWeighted())
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Arctic-1", "Arctic-2", 6)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Arctic-2", "Arctic-3", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Arctic-3", "Arctic-Gateway", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Arctic-1", "Arctic-Gateway", 9)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Arctic-2", "Arctic-Gateway", 8)

	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-1", "Equator-2", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-2", "Equator-3", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-3", "Equator-4", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-1", "Equator-4", 8)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-2", "Equator-4", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Equator-1", "Equator-3", 6)

	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Pacific-Relay", "Pacific-1", 7)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Pacific-Relay", "Pacific-2", 6)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Pacific-1", "Pacific-2", 10)

    result, err := mst.MinimumSpanningTree(
        graph,
        mst.WithAlgorithm(mst.AlgorithmPrim),
        mst.WithForest(),
    )
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("msf:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf(
        "algorithm=%s mode=%s satellites=%d links=%d components=%d roots=%v total=%.0f\n",
        result.Algorithm,
        result.Mode,
        result.VertexCount,
        len(result.Edges),
        result.ComponentCount,
        result.ComponentRoots,
        result.TotalWeight,
    )

    // Output:

### 6.8.3. Embedding clustering by cutting MST bridges

The graph represents distances between embedding prototypes. Kruskal builds the similarity backbone; cutting the two largest selected edges yields three clusters.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"

    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/core"
    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/mst"
)

func main() {
    graph, _ := core.NewGraph(core.WithWeighted())
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("vision-01", "vision-02", 0.12)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("vision-02", "vision-03", 0.15)

### 6.8.4. Smart-grid sentinel classification

The graph mixes undirected physical power links with a directed telemetry/control relation. MST rejects the directed edge-level override before tree construction.

```go
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/core"
    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/mst"
)

func main() {
    graph, _ := core.NewGraph(core.WithWeighted(), core.WithMixedEdges())
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("SolarFarm-A", "Substation-A", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("WindPark-B", "Substation-B", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Substation-A", "Substation-B", 3)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("Substation-B", "BatteryHub", 2)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("BatteryHub", "HospitalLoop", 6)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("HospitalLoop", "DowntownLoad", 4)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("DowntownLoad", "IndustrialLoad", 5)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("IndustrialLoad", "Substation-A", 7)
	_, _ = graph.AddEdge("MicrogridIsland", "BatteryHub", 8)

    if _, err := graph.AddEdge("ControlCenter", "Substation-A", 1, core.WithEdgeDirected(true)); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("directed edge:", err)
        return
    }

    _, err := mst.MinimumSpanningTree(graph)

    fmt.Printf(
        "invalid=%t directed_edge=%t\n",
        errors.Is(err, mst.ErrInvalidGraph),
        errors.Is(err, mst.ErrDirectedEdge),
    )

    // Output:
    // invalid=true directed_edge=true
}

## 6.9. Laws of Ownership, Concurrency & Partial Results

### 6.9.1. Ownership Law

The public result is detached.

`Result.Edges` stores `core.Edge` values, not `*core.Edge` pointers.

The snapshot adapter also copies edge values before kernel execution.

Consequences:

- mutating returned edge values does not mutate the source graph,
- `Result.Clone()` deep-copies slice fields,
- `Result.EdgeValues()` returns a caller-owned slice,
- callers may serialize or transform results safely after return.

### 6.9.2. Clone Law

`Clone()` is nil-safe.

```go
var result *mst.Result
clone := result.Clone()
fmt.Println(clone == nil)
```

Output:

```text
true
```

For non-nil results, `Clone()` preserves scalar metadata and deep-copies:

- `Edges`,
- `ComponentRoots`.

### 6.9.3. Nil-result helper law

`EdgeValues()` classifies nil receiver access with `ErrNilResult`.

```go
var result *mst.Result
edges, err := result.EdgeValues()
```

Expected state:

```text
edges == nil
errors.Is(err, mst.ErrNilResult) == true
```

### 6.9.4. Concurrency Law

The package snapshots graph vertices and edges before kernel execution.

Concurrent graph reads are acceptable only when the underlying `core.Graph` usage remains read-only during the algorithm call.

Concurrent mutation during snapshot construction is unsupported.

Do not add, remove, or rewrite graph vertices or edges while `MinimumSpanningTree`, `Kruskal`, or `Prim` is executing on the same graph.

### 6.9.5. Partial-Result Law

The package suppresses partial results.

For any validation failure or strict-tree kernel failure:

```text
result == nil
err != nil
```

Examples:

- nil graph,
- unweighted graph,
- directed graph,
- directed edge override,
- empty graph,
- non-finite weight,
- missing Prim root,
- disconnected graph in strict mode.

Forest mode is not a partial result. It is an explicit publication mode selected by `WithForest()`.

## 6.10. Pitfalls & Best Practices

### 6.10.1. Anti-patterns

>#### Anti-pattern 1: Parsing error strings
>
>Do not branch on `err.Error()`.
>
>Use:
>
>```go
>errors.Is(err, mst.ErrDisconnected)
>```

> #### Anti-pattern 2: Treating `edge.To` as the Prim destination
> 
> Undirected edge values are mirrored into both adjacency lists. The next vertex must be resolved relative to the current source.

> #### Anti-pattern 3: Using epsilon inside MST comparators
> 
> Do not compare MST candidate weights as “approximately less”. Epsilon-based comparison can be non-transitive and can break sort/heap contracts.

> #### Anti-pattern 4: Expecting strict MST on disconnected input
> 
> Strict mode requires one spanning tree over all vertices. Use `WithForest()` when disconnected components are expected and meaningful.

> #### Anti-pattern 5: Treating `+Inf` as unreachable
> 
> This package has no infinite-wall semantics. All non-finite weights are rejected.

> #### Anti-pattern 6: Reusing partial results after errors
> 
> There are no partial MST results. If `err != nil`, treat the result as absent.

> #### Anti-pattern 7: Mutating graph topology during execution
> 
> Do not add/remove vertices or edges while MST/MSF computation is running.

> #### Anti-pattern 8: Assuming Prim and Kruskal must always select identical edges
> 
> They must agree on optimal total weight and structural validity. Equal-weight graphs can have multiple valid MST representatives.

> #### Anti-pattern 9: Discarding result metadata too early
> 
> Do not immediately convert `Result` into a raw edge slice unless the downstream stage truly does not need algorithm, mode, root, component, or total-weight metadata.

### 6.10.2. Best practices

> #### Best practice 1: Model publication policy through options
> 
> Use `WithForest()` for naturally disconnected systems. Do not delete vertices or edges to force strict tree success.

> #### Best practice 2: Use the canonical facade for policy-rich calls
> 
> ```go
> MinimumSpanningTree(graph, WithAlgorithm(AlgorithmPrim), WithRoot("A"), WithForest())
> ```
> 
> Use focused wrappers only when strict tree mode and algorithm choice are fixed.

> #### Best practice 3: Preserve edge IDs for auditability
> 
> Stable edge IDs make deterministic MST output traceable back to source topology.

> #### Best practice 4: Validate data ingestion upstream
> 
> The package rejects non-finite values, but data pipelines should still validate numeric inputs before graph construction.

> #### Best practice 5: Clone before destructive local transforms
> 
> If a downstream stage sorts selected edges by descending weight, clusters by cuts, or filters edges for reporting, use `Clone()` or `EdgeValues()` first.

> #### Best practice 6: Prefer forest mode for islanded systems
> 
> Satellite groups, microgrids, offline regions, disconnected data clusters, and segmented infrastructure often have meaningful disconnected components. Use explicit forest mode.

> #### Best practice 7: Treat strict mode failure as a topology signal
> 
> `ErrDisconnected` in strict mode is not an inconvenience; it is a mathematical statement that the graph cannot be spanned as one tree.

> #### Best practice 8: Keep graph topology stable during execution
> 
> Run MST/MSF over a stable graph. For mutation-heavy systems, build or clone a graph snapshot before invoking the package.

## 6.11. Practical Recipes

### 6.11.1. Cheapest connected backbone

Use the default facade:

```go
result, err := mst.MinimumSpanningTree(graph)
```

Default policy is Kruskal + strict tree.

### 6.11.2. Rooted expansion from an operational hub

Use Prim when the root is meaningful to the workflow:

```go
result, err := mst.Prim(graph, "HQ")
```

This is useful when logs, diagrams, or operational explanations should describe growth from a known site.

### 6.11.3. Islanded network publication

Use explicit forest mode:

```go
result, err := mst.MinimumSpanningTree(graph, mst.WithForest())
```

This is correct for disconnected domains where each component has independent meaning.

### 6.11.4. ML clustering through bridge cuts

Run Kruskal, clone selected edges, sort by descending weight, and remove the largest selected bridges. The MST gives a sparse backbone where heavy selected edges often represent inter-cluster bridges.

### 6.11.5. Sentinel-classified validation

Use `errors.Is`:

```go
if errors.Is(err, mst.ErrDirectedEdge) {
    // The graph contains a directed edge-level override and is outside MST domain.
}
```

**lvlath/mst**: deterministic by contract, strict in graph semantics, finite in numeric policy, and safe to compose through detached `Result` artifacts.
