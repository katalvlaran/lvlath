  lvlath - Repository Tutorial

  Purpose:
    This tutorial is the first educational entry point for lvlath. It introduces
    fundamental graph and matrix ideas, explains how lvlath maps mathematical
    algorithms into deterministic Go packages, and helps readers move from basic
    graph concepts to package-specific documentation. It does not duplicate every
    package specification; instead it teaches the mental model, core entities,
    options, result surfaces, and engineering discipline needed before reading
    docs/{PACKAGE}.md and {package}/doc.go files.

# lvlath Tutorial

> **hard math on an easy level**

Welcome to **lvlath**, a deterministic Go library for graph algorithms, dense graph algebra, flows, routing, tours, fixtures, and time-series alignment.

This tutorial is the beginning of the learning path. It introduces the objects and ideas that most packages share: graphs, matrices, options, result artifacts, error contracts, and deterministic algorithm execution.

## 1. Introduction

### What is lvlath?

`lvlath` is a deterministic Go library for graph algorithms, dense graph algebra, routing, network optimization, time-series alignment, tour planning, and reproducible algorithm fixtures.

It is built around a simple engineering idea:

> Algorithms should publish results you can explain, test, reproduce, and safely compose.

The library covers:

* `core` graph modeling with deterministic topology and explicit capabilities;
* `bfs` hop-distance traversal and weak components;
* `dfs` finish-order traversal, cycle witnesses, and topological sorting;
* `dijkstra` non-negative weighted shortest paths with explicit `+Inf` state semantics;
* `mst` strict minimum spanning trees and explicit minimum spanning forests;
* `flow` max-flow / residual-network analysis;
* `matrix` dense graph algebra: adjacency, incidence, metric closure, statistics, factorization, sanitation;
* `dtw` deterministic Dynamic Time Warping for scalar, cost-matrix, and multivariate sequence alignment;
* `tsp` matrix-backed tour optimization with exact, approximate, matching, and local-search regimes;
* `gridgraph` generated lattice topology;
* `builder` deterministic fixtures for examples, tests, and benchmarks.

```

### Why lvlath?

Because real algorithm work fails at the edges, not in the textbook recurrence.

A shortest-path formula is easy. A reliable Go package must also answer:

* Is traversal order stable enough for CI and golden tests?
* Is this graph really directed, weighted, loop-enabled, or multi-edge capable?
* Is a missing target different from a known but unreachable target?
* Is a zero edge a real zero-cost edge or an absent edge?
* Is `+Inf` a valid unreachable state or invalid numeric input?
* Is a disconnected MST request an error or an explicit forest request?
* Is a DTW path recoverable under the selected memory mode?
* Is a TSP result exact, approximate, locally improved, or merely a timed-out incumbent?
* Does the returned result own its data, or does it alias the input?

`lvlath` treats those questions as the API, not as afterthoughts.

### What makes lvlath different?

1. **Contract-first packages**

   Each package defines its mathematical domain, result artifact, error law, determinism law, and non-goals. A function is not “just an implementation”; it is a public contract.

2. **Deterministic result surfaces**

   Stable graph order, deterministic tie-breaks, strict improvement laws, fixed DP traversal, deterministic matching/local-search policy, and detached result artifacts make outputs reproducible.

3. **Explicit modeling instead of hidden fallback**

   `mst` does not silently turn strict MST into a forest. `tsp` does not silently replace Blossom matching with Greedy matching. `dtw` does not pretend rolling-row memory can reconstruct a path.

4. **Numeric semantics are package-specific and documented**

   `+Inf` is valid as Dijkstra unreachable distance, matrix absence under explicit policy, DTW no-path accumulated state, or TSP pre-closure missing edge sentinel. It is invalid as an MST weight and invalid as a DTW local cost.

5. **Graph and matrix workflows compose**

   `core` owns topology. `matrix` turns topology into dense artifacts. `dijkstra`, `mst`, `flow`, `tsp`, and `dtw` solve different mathematical questions without collapsing their result meanings.

### Repository laws

1. **Topology is modeled before algorithms run**

   Directedness, weights, loops, multi-edges, and mixed edges are graph capabilities. They are not loose comments around a map.

2. **Different algorithms answer different questions**

   BFS minimizes hops. Dijkstra minimizes non-negative route cost. MST minimizes selected backbone cost. Flow maximizes feasible throughput. DTW minimizes temporal alignment cost. TSP minimizes closed-tour cost.

3. **Result artifacts carry meaning**

   Do not reduce results to “a slice and a number.” A result may contain reachability, path tracking, exactness, approximation ratio, timeout state, component roots, residual capacity, matrix policy, or detached IDs.

4. **Policy is explicit and local to the run**

   Filters, thresholds, forest mode, metric closure, local search, matching algorithm, DTW memory mode, and time limits are explicit options. Hidden fallback is not a feature.

5. **Numeric values need domain context**

   `0`, `+Inf`, `NaN`, negative weights, and missing edges are interpreted differently by different packages. Correct code respects the package contract instead of forcing one universal meaning.

---

## 5. Graph Foundations

A graph is:

$$ G = (V, E) $$

where:

* `V` is a set of vertices;
* `E` is a set of edges between vertices.

In `lvlath/core`, vertices are identified by string IDs, and edges carry direction, weight, ID, and policy-dependent behavior.

### Core capabilities

| Capability           | What it controls                           | Typical use                                              |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| `WithDirected(true)` | Default orientation of edges.              | Dependency graphs, one-way roads, call graphs.           |
| `WithWeighted()`     | Non-zero `float64` edge values.            | Cost, distance, latency, capacity.                       |
| `WithLoops()`        | Self-edges such as `A -> A`.               | State machines, roundabouts, internal transitions.       |
| `WithMultiEdges()`   | Parallel edges between the same endpoints. | Road + rail, multiple network links, redundant channels. |
| `WithMixedEdges()`   | Per-edge direction overrides.              | City maps with one-way streets and two-way roads.        |

### Storage intuition

```text
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| core.Graph                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vertices:       map[string]*Vertex                               |
| edges:          map[string]*Edge                                 |
| adjacency:      map[fromID]map[toID]map[edgeID]struct{}          |
| config:         directed / weighted / loops / multi / mixed      |
| locks:          vertex/config lock + edge/adjacency lock         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
            │                         │
            │                         └── edge IDs preserve identity
            │
            └── vertex IDs are the stable public coordinate system
```

### Directed vs undirected

```text
Directed edge A -> B:

   [A] ──▶ [B]

Storage intent:
   A can reach B through this edge.
   B does not automatically reach A.

Undirected edge A -- B:

   [A] ◀──▶ [B]

Storage intent:
   Traversal can move both ways.
```

### Weight is not just decoration

```text
Unweighted graph:
  all edges have weight 0;
  BFS/DFS are natural tools.

Weighted graph:
  edge values carry cost/capacity/distance;
  Dijkstra, MST, flow, matrix closure, and TSP become meaningful.
```

---

## 6. First Rich Graph: Build, Inspect, Traverse

The first example should be visually useful, not a toy line. We use a 10-vertex directed service graph with a central loop, two branches, and a storage tail.

### What to notice

* `BFS.Depth` is a shortest-hop certificate.
* `BFS.PathTo` reconstructs one deterministic shortest path from `StartID`.
* `DFS.Order` is finish order, not discovery order.
* `Components` answers weak connectivity and should not be confused with strongly connected components.

### Layer visualization

```text
Depth 0:   incident
              │
Depth 1:   gateway
           /      \
Depth 2: auth     api
          │        │
Depth 3: profile  search
          │        │
Depth 4: db       index
          │       /    \
Depth 5: backup  cache  profile(already discovered earlier)
```

## 7. Graph Algorithms on the Same Topology

The fastest way to misuse graph libraries is to treat every algorithm as “pathfinding.” `lvlath` keeps the objective visible.

### BFS: hop-distance and frontier waves

Use BFS when every edge has equal cost and you care about layers.

```text
Objective:
  minimize number of edges

Result meaning:
  Depth[v] = shortest hop count from start
  Parent[v] = deterministic shortest-hop witness tree
```

Good questions:

* “Which services are within 2 hops?”
* “What is the blast radius wave by wave?”
* “Which weak components exist?”

### DFS: structure, finish order, cycles

Use DFS when completion structure matters.

```text
Objective:
  inspect depth-first structure

Important law:
  DFSResult.Order = finish order, not discovery order
```

Good questions:

* “Can this dependency graph be topologically sorted?”
* “Where is a deterministic cycle witness?”
* “What is the post-order structure of this graph?”

### Dijkstra: non-negative weighted routing

Use Dijkstra when edge weights are costs.

```text
Objective:
  minimize sum of non-negative edge weights

Relaxation:
  candidate = dist[u] + weight(u,v)
  update only on strict improvement
```

Good questions:

* “What is the cheapest route from ingress to storage?”
* “Which target is known but unreachable under a wall policy?”
* “What route witness produced this cost?”

### MST: cheapest acyclic backbone

Use MST when you need connectivity with minimum selected edge cost, not route distance.

```text
Strict MST:
  connect all vertices with |V|-1 selected edges.

Explicit MSF:
  one MST per connected component, requested deliberately.
```

Good questions:

* “What is the cheapest cable, fiber, or relay backbone?”
* “Is the network disconnected when strict connectivity is required?”
* “Which component-wise backbones exist if forest mode is acceptable?”

### Flow: maximum feasible throughput

Use flow when weights are capacities.

```text
Objective:
  maximize source-to-sink flow

Residual graph:
  records remaining forward capacity and possible reverse cancellation.
```

Good questions:

* “How much traffic can reach storage?”
* “Which cut limits throughput?”
* “What residual capacity remains after routing maximum flow?”

### TSP: closed tour over a complete cost model

Use TSP when the result must visit every required stop exactly once and return to start.

```text
Objective:
  minimize closed Hamiltonian tour cost

Input model:
  complete finite matrix after optional metric closure
```

Good questions:

* “What is the best inspection/delivery route?”
* “Do I need exact optimality or a heuristic/local-search result?”
* “Can I claim a Christofides ratio, or did I choose weaker matching?”

### DTW: temporal alignment, not graph routing

Use DTW when two sequences describe the same process at different speeds.

```text
Objective:
  minimize accumulated alignment cost through a time-time grid

Path meaning:
  diagonal = both advance
  vertical/horizontal = one side stretches
```

Good questions:

* “Do these two vibration signatures match despite phase drift?”
* “Which phase was stretched?”
* “Can I afford path recovery, or do I only need distance?”

---

## 8. Matrix Foundations

Graphs describe relationships. Matrices make those relationships computable.

`lvlath/matrix` is the dense layer for:

* adjacency and incidence artifacts;
* metric closure / all-pairs shortest paths;
* degree vectors and reductions;
* row-major dense algebra;
* LU, QR, inverse, symmetric eigen decomposition;
* covariance, correlation, row normalization;
* numeric sanitation and tolerant comparison.

### Matrix core capabilities

| Capability                 | What it controls                        | Why it matters                                                    |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dense` row-major storage  | One flat `[]float64` buffer.            | Predictable memory layout and fast loops.                         |
| `Matrix` interface         | `Rows`, `Cols`, `At`, `Set`, `Clone`.   | Kernels can accept dense and wrapped/fallback inputs.             |
| `NewPreparedDense` options | Finite/`+Inf` admissibility.            | Numeric policy is explicit.                                       |
| `View`                     | Shared no-copy submatrix.               | Block assembly and write-through workflows.                       |
| `Induced`                  | Copied submatrix by selected rows/cols. | Independent result artifact.                                      |
| Graph adapters             | Adjacency, incidence, metric closure.   | Topology becomes numeric data without losing policy.              |
| Sanitizers                 | `ReplaceInfNaN`, `Clip`.                | Raw telemetry becomes safe for statistics/algebra.                |
| Comparators                | `AllClose`.                             | Tests compare numeric results by tolerance, not fragile equality. |

### Storage intuition

A dense matrix with `R` rows and `C` columns stores `(i,j)` at:

$$ offset(i,j)=i \times C+j $$

```text
Logical 3×4 matrix:

      c0   c1   c2   c3
r0  [ a00  a01  a02  a03 ]
r1  [ a10  a11  a12  a13 ]
r2  [ a20  a21  a22  a23 ]

Physical row-major storage:

[ a00 a01 a02 a03 | a10 a11 a12 a13 | a20 a21 a22 a23 ]
  row 0 contiguous   row 1 contiguous   row 2 contiguous
```

### Graph-to-matrix semantics

```text
Adjacency matrix: V × V
  cell(i,j) means relation from vertex i to vertex j.

Incidence matrix: V × E
  column(k) means structural contribution of edge k.

Metric closure: V × V
  cell(i,j) means shortest-path distance, not original edge existence.
```

### Zero and infinity law

```text
Classic adjacency:
  0 may mean “no edge”.

Zero-preserving weighted adjacency:
  finite 0 may mean “real zero-cost edge”;
  +Inf means absence.

Metric closure:
  finite value means shortest distance;
  +Inf means unreachable.

Sanitation/statistics:
  NaN and invalid Inf values must be cleaned or rejected before analysis.
```

### Matrix as bridge to other packages

`matrix` is not isolated from graph algorithms:

* Dijkstra-style route outputs can become dense distance surfaces.
* TSP consumes matrix-backed complete cost models.
* Spectral analysis starts from adjacency or symmetrized adjacency.
* Flow/cut analysis can use incidence-style structural thinking.
* DTW can align matrix rows as multivariate time steps through `dtw.AlignMatrix`.

---

## 9. Graph-to-Matrix Example: Incident Routing, Closure, and Spectral-Ready Data

This example models a small incident-response service network.

The story is intentionally realistic:

* `edge` receives user traffic;
* requests split into authentication and API paths;
* `profile`, `search`, and `index` represent service dependencies;
* `db -> backup` is a real zero-cost replication edge;
* `logs` and `archive` preserve operational evidence;
* the same topology can feed routing, dense matrices, spectral analysis, MST backbone planning, flow capacity analysis, TSP inspection tours, and DTW telemetry comparison.

The goal of this section is not to run every package in one oversized code block. The goal is to show the **graph-to-matrix foundation** that later packages can reuse.

```text
Incident-response service graph
weights = latency / operational cost

                   
        ┌──────────2────────────▶ auth ─────1────▶ profile ─────2────▶ db
        │                           └─4─┐                               │
        │                               │                               │0
        │                               ▼                               ▼
      edge ────3────▶ api ─────4────▶ search ─────3────▶ logs ───2──▶ backup
        │              │                │
        │              │2               │1
        │              ▼                ▼
        └─────6────▶ cache             index ─────5────▶ archive

Important semantics:
  - `db -> backup = 0` is a real zero-cost replication link.
  - missing edges are not zero-cost edges.
  - metric closure answers shortest reachable distance, not original topology.
  - symmetrized adjacency is a derived operator for spectral inspection.

### What this example proves

* `core.NewGraph` models topology and capability: directed + weighted.
* `matrix.NewMatrixOptions` is the graph-to-matrix policy boundary.
* `matrix.NewAdjacencyMatrix` gives string vertices deterministic dense coordinates.
* `matrix.WithPreserveZeroWeights` keeps a real zero-cost edge distinct from absence.
* `matrix.BuildMetricClosure` turns topology into shortest-distance data.
* `matrix.Symmetrize` prepares a derived operator for symmetric spectral analysis.
* `matrix.EigenSym` demonstrates that graph-derived matrices can become numeric-analysis inputs.

|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bfs`       | Hop blast radius: “which services are within 2 calls of `edge`?”                           |
| `dfs`       | Dependency cycle audit before deployment.                                                  |

| `gridgraph` | Model the same incident over a datacenter floor or network zone map.                       |
| `builder`   | Generate repeatable larger incident fixtures for tests and benchmarks.                     |

### Spectral interpretation

The eigen step is not “magic centrality.” It is a compact structural signal over a derived symmetric operator.

Use it as:

* a ranking hint for central services;
* a seed for graph clustering;
* a sanity check before heavier analytics;
* a feature source for dashboards or anomaly models.

Do not use it as:

* proof of causality;
* replacement for shortest-path or flow analysis;
* direct evidence that an edge exists in the original directed graph.

## 11. Professional Best Practices

### 11.1. Start from the objective, not the function name

```text
min hops                         -> bfs
post-order / cycle / DAG order    -> dfs
min non-negative route cost       -> dijkstra
min acyclic backbone cost         -> mst
max feasible throughput           -> flow
all-pairs distances               -> matrix metric closure
dense topology/statistics         -> matrix
time-warped sequence similarity   -> dtw
closed tour cost                  -> tsp
```

### 11.2. Model graph capabilities honestly

Do not enable options “just in case.” A directed weighted multi-edge graph is not more correct than a simple graph; it is a different domain model.

### 11.3. Keep topology stable while algorithms run

`core` protects storage. Algorithm meaning still assumes the topology is not being changed underneath the run. Clone, freeze, or synchronize if reproducibility matters.

### 11.4. Prefer policy over destructive graph edits

Use filters, wall thresholds, max-distance cutoffs, forest mode, metric closure, matrix options, DTW windows, and TSP time limits instead of rewriting input data to simulate one run.

### 11.5. Preserve result meaning

Do not collapse rich result artifacts into anonymous tuples. Inspect the fields that matter:

* BFS: `Depth`, `Parent`, `Visited`, `Order`;
* DFS: finish `Order` and cycle/topology state;
* Dijkstra: known/unreachable/path-tracked states;
* MST: `Mode`, `ComponentCount`, `ComponentRoots`;
* Flow: residual graph;
* DTW: `Reachable`, `PathTracked`, `MemoryMode`;
* TSP: `Exact`, `Optimal`, `TimedOut`, `ApproximationRatio`.

### 11.6. Treat numeric sentinels by package contract

`+Inf` can be correct in Dijkstra, matrix metric closure, and DTW no-path states. It is not a valid MST weight or DTW local cost. Do not invent one universal numeric policy.

### 11.7. Sanitize before statistics and spectral workflows

Raw telemetry can contain `NaN`, `Inf`, spikes, and unit-scale drift. Use sanitation and normalization before covariance, correlation, eigen analysis, or multivariate DTW.

### 11.8. Preserve zero-weight edges deliberately

A zero-cost replication or transfer edge is real topology. Use zero-preserving matrix policy when absence must be distinguishable from finite zero.

### 11.9. Be honest about exactness and guarantees

* MST is exact for its domain.
* Dijkstra is exact for non-negative single-source routing.
* Flow algorithms solve max-flow under capacity semantics.
* Held-Karp / completed Branch-and-Bound are exact TSP regimes.
* Branch-and-Bound with timeout may return a feasible incumbent, not proof.
* Christofides’ `1.5` ratio requires metric input and exact Blossom matching.
* 2-opt/3-opt are improvements, not optimality certificates.
* DTW distance is not generally a metric.

### 11.10. Make examples deterministic and inspectable

Avoid unstable map printing, time-flaky cancellation, hidden random seeds, and helper-heavy examples that obscure public calls. A good example shows:

```text
build input -> choose policy -> run algorithm -> inspect result fields
```

### 11.11. Benchmark the shape you claim

Sparse graph traversal, dense matrix kernels, flow residual pressure, DTW full-matrix mode, TSP exact search, and local search are different regimes. Benchmark them separately and name the regime clearly.
