# 3. BFS (Breadth-First Search)

> **Package:** `lvlath/bfs` | **Focus:** Determinism, Unweighted Shortest Paths, Partial Results, Weak Connectivity, Memory-Safe Traversal

The `lvlath/bfs` package provides a deterministic, contract-driven implementation of Breadth-First Search over `core.Graph`.
It is engineered not as a throwaway helper, but as a foundational algorithmic primitive for packages that need stable hop-distance traversal, reproducible tie-break behavior, and debuggable interruption semantics.

Unlike casual BFS snippets that silently depend on map iteration, blur the meaning of discovery versus visit, or discard useful state on cancellation, `lvlath/bfs` treats traversal as a disciplined protocol:

- the graph layer defines the deterministic neighbor relation,
- the BFS layer preserves and interprets it without hidden policy,
- the result layer exposes stable, mathematically meaningful artifacts.

---

## 3.1. What & Why

Why use `lvlath/bfs` instead of a handwritten queue loop or a generic helper?

### The Four Laws of BFS

1. **Deterministic Frontier Expansion**
    *   *Others:* Frequently inherit unstable order from maps, ad-hoc adjacency containers, or edge enumeration side effects.
    *   *Lvlath:* Expands neighbors in the exact order returned by `core.Graph.NeighborIDs(u)`. BFS itself does not sort neighbors and does not invent a second tie-break rule.

2. **Visit-Time Semantics Are Explicit**
    *   *Others:* Blur the distinction between discovered, queued, and visited, which makes hooks and partial results ambiguous.
    *   *Lvlath:* Defines `visit = dequeue`. `Order` is dequeue order, `Visited` is discovery-at-enqueue, and `OnVisit` runs only when a vertex is actually processed.

3. **Partial Result Is a Valid Outcome**
    *   *Others:* Fail or cancel mid-traversal and throw away useful state.
    *   *Lvlath:* Returns a partial `BFSResult` plus the error on context cancellation, neighbor enumeration failure, or hook failure.

4. **Queue Retention Is Engineered Away**
    *   *Others:* Use `queue = queue[1:]`, which may retain the backing array and keep old references alive longer than intended.
    *   *Lvlath:* Uses a head-index queue with slot clearing, preserving BFS mathematics while improving operational behavior.

### What BFS returns
`lvlath/bfs` returns a result object that is simultaneously:

- a deterministic traversal trace,
- an unweighted shortest-path certificate,
- a policy and observability artifact.

Concretely:

- `Order` answers: in what exact order were vertices processed?
- `Depth` answers: how many hops away is each discovered vertex?
- `Parent` answers: through which predecessor was each vertex first discovered?
- `PathTo` answers: what is one shortest path from the start to a target?
- `Skipped` answers: how many neighbor relations were rejected by traversal policy?

### Why this matters in practice
BFS is the correct primitive when the domain question is fundamentally about fewest hops, layer boundaries, or reachability under a deterministic relation:

- blast-radius analysis in service graphs,
- dependency-wave expansion,
- policy-gated discovery without mutating topology,
- deterministic audit crawlers and scanners,
- weak component discovery via `Components`.

> **Non-goal:** `lvlath/bfs` does not compute weighted shortest paths.
> If the path objective depends on latency, cost, capacity, or risk, BFS is mathematically the wrong tool.

---

## 3.2. Math Formulation

The BFS package operates on an unweighted neighbor relation induced by `core.Graph.NeighborIDs`.
Distances are measured in edge count, not stored edge weight.

### 3.2.1. Hop Distance
For a source vertex `s` and target vertex `v`, BFS computes the minimum number of edges on any valid traversal path:

$$
dist(s,v) = min_{P in Paths(s,v)} |P|
$$

Equivalent edge-sum form:

$$
dist(s,v) = min_{paths s -> v} sum_{e in P} 1
$$

This is the exact quantity represented by `Depth[v]` when `v` is reachable from `s`.

### 3.2.2. BFS Layer Partition
BFS partitions the discovered region into discrete layers:

$$
L_d = { v in V | dist(s,v) = d }
$$

Traversal proceeds in non-decreasing `d`, which is why the first time a vertex is discovered, its recorded depth is already shortest.

### 3.2.3. Parent Certificate
For every non-root discovered vertex `v` with parent `p = Parent[v]`, BFS maintains:

$$
Depth[v] = Depth[p] + 1
$$

This recurrence is the correctness certificate behind `PathTo(dst)`: following parent links reconstructs one shortest hop path.

### 3.2.4. Discovery Invariant
A vertex is marked visited at enqueue time, not at dequeue time:

$$
Visited[v] = true  =>  v is enqueued at most once
$$

This is the key invariant that prevents duplicate frontier entries and preserves linear-time traversal.

### 3.2.5. Inclusive Radius Bound
With an inclusive maximum depth `D`, the reported reachable set is:

$$
V_{<=D} = { v in V | Depth[v] <= D }
$$

Vertices at depth `D` are still visited and appear in `Order`, but their outgoing neighbor relations are not expanded.

### 3.2.6. Weak Connectivity
For `Components(ctx, g)`, direction is ignored for membership.
Define a symmetric relation `~w` by:

$$
u ~w v  iff  there exists an undirected path between u and v
$$

The weak components are exactly the equivalence classes of `~w`.

### 3.2.7. Forest Semantics Under Full Traversal
With `WithFullTraversal()`, BFS becomes a deterministic forest traversal.
Each secondary root `r` starts a new tree with:

$$
Depth[r] = 0
$$

and no parent entry.

This preserves local shortest-hop depth inside each connected region while intentionally keeping `PathTo` anchored to the original `StartID`.

### 3.2.8. Complexity
For a single-source BFS traversal:

$$
T_BFS = O(|V| + |E|)
$$

$$
S_BFS = O(|V|)
$$

For `WithFullTraversal()`, BFS additionally scans all vertices to select deterministic secondary roots:

$$
T_Forest = O(|V| + |E|) + O(|V|_scan)
$$

For `Components(ctx, g)`, total cost includes deterministic adjacency construction and deterministic output ordering:

$$
T_Components = O(|V| + |E|) + sorting overhead required by stable output
$$

> [!NOTE]
> Exact constants depend on the deterministic snapshot behavior of the underlying `core` APIs, but the algorithmic backbone remains linear in graph size.

## 3.3. Public API & Result Contract

In lvlath, the returned result is not a secondary implementation detail. It is part of the public protocol.
This section intentionally combines package entry points, error priority, result meaning, and interpretation rules.

### 3.3.1. Public Entry Points

```go
func BFS(g *core.Graph, startID string, opts ...Option) (*BFSResult, error)
func Components(ctx context.Context, g *core.Graph) (*ComponentsResult, error)
```

### 3.3.2. Validation Order and Error Priority
The public `BFS` facade validates in the following order:

1. `g == nil` -> `ErrGraphNil`
2. option application failure -> `ErrOptionViolation`
3. `g.Weighted() == true` -> `ErrWeightedGraph`
4. `!g.HasVertex(startID)` -> `ErrStartVertexNotFound`
5. runtime interruption:
    - `ctx.Err()`
    - `ErrNeighbors` on neighbor enumeration failure, double-wrapped with the underlying cause
    - any `OnVisit` error, wrapped with `%w`

This priority is intentional. It keeps diagnosis stable and predictable.

### 3.3.3. BFSResult

```go
type BFSResult struct {
    StartID string
    Order   []string
    Depth   map[string]int
    Parent  map[string]string
    Visited map[string]bool
    Skipped int
}
```

**Field semantics and invariants:**

| Field | Meaning | Safe on partial result? | Key invariant |
|------:|---------|------------------------:|---------------|
| `StartID` | start vertex for this BFS invocation | yes | anchors `PathTo` under forest mode |
| `Order` | dequeue and visit order | yes | visit means dequeue |
| `Depth` | hop distance in edge count | yes | shortest on first discovery |
| `Parent` | BFS tree or forest links | yes | roots have no parent entry |
| `Visited` | discovery set, marked at enqueue | yes | may be a superset of `Order` on early exit |
| `Skipped` | rejected neighbor relations | yes | counts `(currID, nbrID)`, not edge IDs |

### 3.3.4. PathTo

```go
func (r *BFSResult) PathTo(dst string) ([]string, error)
```

`PathTo(dst)` reconstructs one shortest path from `StartID` to `dst`.

- success: returns `[StartID ... dst]`
- failure: returns `(nil, ErrNoPath)`

**Forest safety:**
With `WithFullTraversal()`, `Visited` may contain vertices from other components.
`PathTo` therefore enforces `StartID` anchoring to prevent false paths.

### 3.3.5. ComponentsResult

```go
type ComponentsResult struct {
    Components     [][]string
    Count          int
    UndirectedView bool
}
```

`ComponentsResult` describes weakly-connected components under an undirected relation.
Its determinism contract is:

- each component is lex-sorted,
- the list of components is sorted by a stable key.

### 3.3.6. Partial-Result Contract
On any non-nil error returned after traversal begins, BFS returns a non-nil partial `*BFSResult`.
This is not an implementation accident. It is a documented package guarantee.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Visited` is a discovery set, while `Order` is a processing trace. On early exit, they are intentionally not the same thing.

---

## 3.4. Options & Policy Surface

Options are applied sequentially and are last-writer-wins.
Invalid options are rejected before traversal allocates its working sets.

### 3.4.1. MaxDepth

| Value | Meaning | Behavioral effect |
|------:|---------|-------------------|
| `MaxDepthUnlimited` which is `-1` | unlimited traversal | expand all reachable layers |
| `0` | root-only | visit `StartID`, do not expand neighbors |
| `d > 0` | inclusive limit | visit depth `d`, do not expand from it |

### 3.4.2. FilterNeighbor
`FilterNeighbor` is a relation-level policy:

```go
func(currID, nbrID string) bool
```

It is evaluated on the neighbor relations surfaced by `NeighborIDs(currID)`.
If it returns `false`, BFS does not enqueue `nbrID` from `currID` and increments `Skipped`.

### 3.4.3. Hooks
Hooks are deterministic observers:

- `OnEnqueue` runs when a vertex is discovered,
- `OnDequeue` runs immediately before visit,
- `OnVisit` runs at visit time and can abort traversal.

### 3.4.4. FullTraversal
`WithFullTraversal()` turns single-source BFS into a deterministic forest traversal:

1. BFS explores the component of `StartID`.
2. BFS enumerates `g.Vertices()` in deterministic order.
3. Every still-unvisited vertex becomes a new root with depth zero and no parent.

> [!NOTE]
> Full traversal is for deterministic coverage and indexing, not for multi-source shortest paths.

## 3.5. Pseudocode

### 3.5.1. BFS Kernel

```text
FUNCTION BFS(g, startID, opts...):

  Stage 1: Validate inputs
    - graph is non-nil
    - options are valid
    - graph is unweighted
    - start exists

  Stage 2: Allocate once
    - Order, Depth, Parent, Visited sized from VertexCount
    - queue allocated once
    - head index starts at 0

  Stage 3: Seed root
    - mark StartID visited
    - set Depth[StartID] = 0
    - enqueue StartID

  Stage 4: Core loop
    while head < len(queue):
      if ctx.Done():
        return partial result + ctx.Err()

      u = queue[head]
      clear queue[head]
      head++

      OnDequeue(u)
      append u to Order

      if OnVisit(u) returns error:
        return partial result + error

      if maxDepth is set and Depth[u] >= maxDepth:
        continue

      nbrs = NeighborIDs(u)
      if NeighborIDs fails:
        return partial result + ErrNeighbors + underlying cause

      for each v in nbrs:
        if ctx.Done():
          return partial result + ctx.Err()

        if FilterNeighbor(u, v) rejects:
          Skipped++
          continue

        if v already visited:
          continue

        mark v visited
        Depth[v] = Depth[u] + 1
        Parent[v] = u
        OnEnqueue(v)
        enqueue v

  Stage 5: Optional forest continuation
    if fullTraversal:
      iterate Vertices() in deterministic order
      start a new root for each unvisited vertex

  return result
```

### 3.5.2. Components Kernel

```text
FUNCTION Components(ctx, g):

  Stage 1: Snapshot deterministic vertex order
  Stage 2: Build an undirected adjacency view
  Stage 3: Traverse each unvisited root in deterministic order
  Stage 4: Sort each component and sort the component list

  On ctx cancellation:
    return partial ComponentsResult + ctx.Err()
```

## 3.6. ASCII Diagrams

### 3.6.1. Layered Frontier Expansion

```text
Depth 0:            [S]
                  /  |  \
Depth 1:        [A] [B] [C]
                /         \
Depth 2:      [D]         [E]

Order is dequeue order:
[S, A, B, C, D, E]
```

### 3.6.2. Deterministic Tie-Break and Parent Selection

```text
      S
     / \
    A   B
     \ /
      C

NeighborIDs(S) = [A, B]
NeighborIDs(A) = [C]
NeighborIDs(B) = [C]

C is discovered from A first, so:
  Parent[C] = A
  PathTo(C) = [S, A, C]
```

### 3.6.3. MaxDepth Inclusive Cut

```text
S -- A -- D
 \  |
  \ B -- E
   \
    C

MaxDepth = 1

Visited and ordered:
  S, A, B, C

Not expanded:
  A, B, C

Not reached:
  D, E
```

### 3.6.4. Discovery Versus Visit on Early Interruption

```text
Queue state before interruption:
  queue = [S, A, B, C]
  head  = 2

Meaning:
  Order   = [S, A]
  Visited = {S, A, B, C}

Interpretation:
  B and C were discovered and queued,
  but they were not yet visited.
```

### 3.6.5. FullTraversal Forest

```text
Component #1:  A -- B -- C
Component #2:  M -- N
Component #3:  X -- Y -- Z

StartID = A

Forest order:
  [A, B, C, M, N, X, Y, Z]

Depths by root:
  A=0  B=1  C=2
  M=0  N=1
  X=0  Y=1  Z=2
```

### 3.6.6. Weak Components

```text
Directed edges:
  A -> B -> C
  X -> Y

Weak components ignore direction for membership:
  {A, B, C}
  {X, Y}

This is weak connectivity,
not strong connectivity.
```

---

## 3.7. Go Example

A production-style example: service dependency exploration with a deterministic early-stop policy.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "errors"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/bfs"
    "github.com/katalvlaran/lvlath/core"
)

func main() {
    g := core.NewGraph(core.WithDirected(true))

    edges := [][2]string{
        {"gateway", "auth"},
        {"gateway", "billing"},
        {"gateway", "search"},
        {"auth", "users"},
        {"auth", "sessions"},
        {"billing", "ledger"},
        {"billing", "db"},
        {"search", "index"},
        {"users", "db"},
        {"sessions", "cache"},
        {"ledger", "archive"},
        {"index", "cache"},
    }

    for _, e := range edges {
        _, _ = g.AddEdge(e[0], e[1], 0)
    }

    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()

    res, err := bfs.BFS(
        g,
        "gateway",
        bfs.WithContext(ctx),
        bfs.WithOnVisit(func(id string, depth int) error {
            if id == "ledger" {
                cancel()
            }
            return nil
        }),
    )

    fmt.Println("canceled:", errors.Is(err, context.Canceled))
    fmt.Println("order:", res.Order)
    fmt.Println("depth to db:", res.Depth["db"])

    if path, pathErr := res.PathTo("db"); pathErr == nil {
        fmt.Println("path to db:", path)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("path to db unavailable:", pathErr)
    }
}
```

**What this example teaches:**
- deterministic traversal from `gateway`,
- cancellation via deterministic hook trigger,
- partial result consumption after cancellation,
- shortest-hop path reconstruction when the target has already been discovered.

---

## 3.8. Pitfalls & Best Practices (Architectural Mastery)

### 1. Do not parse error strings
Use `errors.Is` with sentinels such as `bfs.ErrNoPath`, `bfs.ErrNeighbors`, and `bfs.ErrOptionViolation`.
String parsing is brittle and is not part of the contract.

### 2. Do not use timeouts for deterministic examples or tests
Use `context.WithCancel` and cancel from a deterministic hook condition.
Timeout-based examples are flaky under CI load and distort traversal semantics.

### 3. Understand the difference between `Visited` and `Order`
- `Visited` means discovered and enqueued.
- `Order` means dequeued and processed.

On partial results, `Visited` may strictly contain more vertices than `Order`.

### 4. Do not confuse FullTraversal with multi-source shortest paths
`WithFullTraversal()` builds a deterministic forest for coverage and indexing.
It does not redefine `PathTo` into a global forest-path operator.

### 5. Keep hooks deterministic and light
Hooks run in hot paths.
They should not allocate heavily, block unpredictably, or mutate graph topology.

### 6. Use FilterNeighbor for policy, not topology mutation
If the traversal policy says a relation is forbidden, reject it in `FilterNeighbor` and use `Skipped` as an audit counter.
Do not mutate the underlying graph just to express traversal policy.

### 7. Weighted graphs are intentionally rejected
BFS answers a hop-distance question.
If the graph is weighted and the business question depends on weights, switch algorithms rather than forcing BFS to answer the wrong question.

### 8. Treat determinism as a feature, not as an accident
If traversal order changes, that is usually either:
- a change in graph neighbor ordering,
- a change in vertex ordering for full traversal,
- or a real regression.

Downstream algorithms should rely on this reproducibility.

---

## 3.9. Practical Recipes

### Recipe A. Blast Radius
Run `BFS(start, WithMaxDepth(k))` and group vertices by `Depth`.
This yields deterministic k-hop waves around the source.

### Recipe B. Policy Firewall
Use `WithFilterNeighbor` to block forbidden relations while leaving topology intact.
Use `Skipped` as a reproducible audit signal.

### Recipe C. Deterministic Crawler
Use `WithContext(ctx)` and cancel from `OnVisit` when a domain rule triggers.
Consume the partial `Order`, `Visited`, and `Depth` maps for diagnostics.

### Recipe D. Weak Island Discovery
Use `Components(ctx, g)` to enumerate weakly-connected islands.
This is the correct primitive when direction should not split membership.

### Recipe E. Forest Indexing
Use `WithFullTraversal()` when you need deterministic coverage of every connected region from a known primary start vertex.
