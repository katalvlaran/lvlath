# 7. Max-Flow: Ford-Fulkerson / Edmonds-Karp / Dinic

---

## 7.1 What, Why, When

### 7.1.1. What
A **maximum-flow** problem seeks the largest possible “flow” from a designated **source** vertex \(s\) to a **sink** vertex \(t\) in a **flow network** \(G = (V, E)\). Each directed edge \((u \to v)\) carries a **capacity** \(c(u,v)\) limiting the amount of flow \(f(u,v)\) it can carry. A valid flow must satisfy:

1. **Capacity constraints**

   $$0 \;\le\; f(u,v)\;\le\; c(u,v) \quad\forall\;(u,v)\in E$$ .

2. **Flow conservation**

   $$\sum_{u:(u\to v)\in E} f(u,v) \;=\; \sum_{w:(v\to w)\in E} f(v,w) \quad\forall\,v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$$ .

The **value** of a flow is the total outflow from the source

$$|f| \;=\; \sum_{v:(s\to v)\in E} f(s,v) \;=\; \sum_{u:(u\to t)\in E} f(u,t)$$ .

### 7.1.2. Why
- **Network routing & traffic engineering**: maximize throughput under link-capacity limits.
- **Bipartite matching & scheduling**: model assignments or resource allocation as flows.
- **Cut-based analysis**: by the max-flow/min-cut theorem, the maximum flow equals the capacity of the minimum cut, giving insight into network bottlenecks.

### 7.1.3. When
Use a max-flow algorithm whenever you need to **optimize** the distribution of a **limited resource** through a directed network, subject to per-edge capacity constraints. Common scenarios include:

- Ensuring the greatest data traffic from a server to clients.
- Assigning tasks to workers under workload limits.
- Analyzing vulnerability points (min-cuts) in infrastructure.

---

### 7.2. Mathematical Formulation

Given a directed graph `(G=(V,E)` and capacities $$\(c: E \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}\)$$, we seek a flow

$$f: E \;\to\; \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$$

satisfying:

1. **Capacity constraints**

   $$0 \;\le\; f(u,v)\;\le\; c(u,v), \quad\forall\;(u,v)\in E$$ .

2. **Conservation of flow**

   $$\sum_{u\colon(u,v)\in E} f(u,v)\;=\; \sum_{w\colon(v,w)\in E} f(v,w), \quad\forall\,v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$$ .

3. **Maximize**

   $$|f| \;=\; \sum_{v\colon(s,v)\in E} f(s,v)\;=\; \sum_{u\colon(u,t)\in E} f(u,t)$$ .

We introduce the **residual capacity**

$$c_f(u,v) \;=\; c(u,v) \;-\; f(u,v), \quad c_f(v,u) \;=\; f(u,v)$$ ,

which yields a **residual graph** $$\(G_f\)$$ whose edges represent remaining forward capacity and potential to cancel previous flow.


## 7.3. Algorithms Overview

---
### 7.3.1. Ford-Fulkerson (DFS)

#### Core Idea
Use a **depth-first search (DFS)** to find **any** path from source `(s)` to sink `(t)` in the **residual graph** $$(G_f)$$ that has **positive residual capacity** on every edge. Once a path is found, **augment** (push) the maximum possible flow (the **bottleneck**) along that path, update the residual capacities, and repeat until no augmenting path remains.

#### Features
- **Simplicity**: Easiest max‑flow algorithm to understand and implement.
- **On‑the‑fly residual graph**: Maintained implicitly via two maps:
   - Forward capacity:  $$(c_f(u, v) = c(u, v) − f(u, v))$$
   - Reverse capacity:  $$(c_f(v, u) = f(u, v))$$
- **Arbitrary path selection**: `DFS` explores edges in arbitrary order, not necessarily shortest.

#### Improvements & Advantages
- Ideal for **small** or **integral** networks where total flow `(F)` is modest.
- Requires only **O(V+E)** extra memory for DFS stack and residual map.
- Serves as a foundation for more advanced algorithms (e.g., `Dinic`, `Push-Relabel`).

---

#### Complexity
- **Time**: $$(O(E \times F))$$, where `(F)` is the integer maximum flow.
- **Memory**: $$(O(V + E))$$ for the residual capacity map and DFS stack.

---

#### Pseudocode
```text
procedure FordFulkerson(G, s, t):
  for each edge (u,v) in G:
    resid[u][v] ← capacity(u,v)
    resid[v][u] ← 0  // initialize reverse edges
  maxFlow ← 0

  repeat:
    visited ← empty set
    (path, bottleneck) ← DFS_FindPath(s, t, ∞)
    if bottleneck = 0 then
      break  // no more augmenting paths
    for each consecutive (u→v) in path:
      resid[u][v] ← resid[u][v] - bottleneck
      resid[v][u] ← resid[v][u] + bottleneck
    maxFlow ← maxFlow + bottleneck
  until false

  return maxFlow

function DFS_FindPath(u, t, flow):
  if u = t then return ( [t], flow )
  mark u as visited
  for each v adjacent to u where resid[u][v] > 0:
    if v not visited:
      f ← min(flow, resid[u][v])
      (subpath, bottleneck) ← DFS_FindPath(v, t, f)
      if bottleneck > 0:
        return ( [u] ++ subpath, bottleneck )
  return ( [], 0 )
```

#### Highlights
- **Residual network**: dynamically updated map of forward/reverse capacities.
- **DFS stop condition**: visits each reachable vertex at most once per augment.
- **Augment**: path length $$(\le V)$$ ; update cost proportional to path length.

```
Edges and capacities:
```
  s→a=5,  s→c=15
  a→b=8,  b→d=10
  c→d=5,  c→e=10
  e→d=10, d→t=10
  e→t=5
```

1. **First DFS** may explore `s→a→b→d→t`:
   - Bottleneck = min(5, 8, 10, 10) = **5**
   - Augment by 5 along that path.
   - Residual forward(s→a)=0, reverse(a→s)=5; forward(a→b)=3, reverse(b→a)=5; … forward(d→t)=5, reverse(t→d)=5.

2. **Second DFS** restarts at `s`.  Suppose it finds `s→c→e→t`:
   - Bottleneck = min(15, 10, 5) = **5**
   - Augment by 5.
   - Residual(s→c)=10, (c→s)=5; (e→t)=0, (t→e)=5.

3. **Third DFS** may find `s→c→d→t`:
   - Bottleneck = min(10, (5+10 reverse?)6?, 5) = **5**
   - (Exact values depend on residual ordering.)

4. Repeat until no path from `s` to `t` with positive capacity exists.
   - **Total flow** = 5 + 5 + … = **Fₘₐₓ = 15**.

This scenario highlights how arbitrary `DFS` paths (not shortest) still yield the correct maximum flow after successive augmentations.

### 7.3.2. Edmonds-Karp (Breadth‑First Search)

#### Core Idea
Always choose the shortest (fewest‑edge) augmenting path from source `S` to sink `T` by performing a BFS on the **residual network**.  This strategy bounds the number of augmentations and guarantees a worst‑case **polynomial** time complexity.

#### Features & Advantages

- **Shortest‑path selection**: `BFS` ensures each augmenting path increases the distance (in edges) between  `S` and `T` by at least `1` before being reused.
- **Polynomial bound**: Guarantees `O(V · E²)` runtime on integer capacities versus `O(E · F)` for naive `DFS`.
- **Deterministic performance**: More predictable than Ford-Fulkerson, especially on adversarial networks.
- **Simple to implement**: Leverages familiar `BFS`, minimal extra data structures.

#### Complexity

- **Time**: `O(V · E²)` in the worst case (each of up to `O(E · F)` augmentations uses `O(E)` `BFS`, but path lengths strictly increase).
- **Memory**: `O(V + E)` for residual map and `BFS` queue.

#### Pseudocode
```text
procedure EdmondsKarp(G, S, T):
  initialize flow f(u,v) = 0 for all (u,v)
  build residual capacities r(u,v) = c(u,v)
  maxFlow ← 0
  while true:
    # 1. BFS to find shortest augmenting path
    parent[] ← empty, bottleneck[] ← 0
    queue ← [S], bottleneck[S] ← ∞
    while queue not empty and bottleneck[T] = 0:
      u ← dequeue(queue)
      for each neighbor v of u with r(u,v) > 0 and bottleneck[v] = 0:
        parent[v] ← u
        bottleneck[v] ← min(bottleneck[u], r(u,v))
        enqueue(queue, v)
    if bottleneck[T] = 0:
      break   # no more augmenting paths
    # 2. Augment along path
    flowAmount ← bottleneck[T]
    v ← T
    while v ≠ S:
      u ← parent[v]
      r(u,v) ← r(u,v) - flowAmount
      r(v,u) ← r(v,u) + flowAmount
      v ← u
    maxFlow ← maxFlow + flowAmount
  return maxFlow
```

#### Highlights
- **BFS distance labels** prevent cycling on long paths.
- **Bottleneck tracking** in `BFS` avoids separate scan to compute minimum capacity.
- **Reverse edges** in residual graph allow cancellation of previous flows.

#### ASCII Example (9 vertices, 19 edges)
```
          [S]
         / | \
       5/ 7|  \15
       /   |   \
    [A]   [B]   [C]
     | \   |   / |
    8| 3\ 6|  /5 |10
     |   \ | /   |
    [D]─7─[E]─8─[F]
     | \     \   |
    7|  \2    \4 |6
     |   \     \ |
    [G]─9─[H]─8─[T]
```

1. **Graph details** (10 vertices, 19 directed edges):
   - **Vertices**: `S, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, T`
   - **Capacities** assigned as per edge list (e.g., `(S→A)=5, (B→E)=6, (H→T)=4`).
2. **First BFS** from `S` discovers shortest path `S → B → E → H → T`:
   - **Bottleneck** = `min(r[S,B]=7, r[B,E]=6, r[E,H]=7, r[H,T]=4) = 4`.
   - **Augment** 4 units: subtract from forward edges, add to reverse edges.
3. **Second BFS** finds next shortest path `S → C → F → T`:
   - **Residual** capacities updated from step 2; new bottleneck `min(15, 10, 6) = 6`.
   - **Flow** +6 → cumulative = 10.
4. **Subsequent BFS** rounds fill remaining capacity through `S→A→E→T`, `S→C→E→T`, etc., until no residual path exists.
5. **Result**: **MaxFlow = 14**, representing the network’s total throughput under capacity constraints.

*The Edmonds-Karp method above illustrates how prioritizing shortest augmenting paths yields stable, provably bounded performance, crucial for networks with adversarial or high‐capacity configurations.*

### 7.3.3. Dinic (Level Graph + Blocking Flow)

#### Core Idea
Dinic’s algorithm accelerates the classic augmenting‐path approach by layering the network into a _level graph_ and then finding _blocking flows_ that saturate all shortest paths in one `BFS`-`DFS` round. This dramatically reduces the number of augmentations compared to naive `DFS` or `BFS` alone.

#### Key Features
- **Level Graph Construction**: A `BFS` from the source partitions vertices by their distance (in edges) from `s`. Only edges **u→v** with remaining capacity and `level[v] = level[u] + 1` are retained.
- **Blocking Flow**: On the level graph, a `DFS` repeatedly pushes flow along disjoint shortest paths until no more augmenting path exists within this level structure.
- **Repeat**: Once the blocking flow is exhausted, rebuild the level graph and repeat until the sink `t` is unreachable.
- **Optional Level Rebuild Interval**: For large networks, you may choose to rebuild the level graph after a fixed number of `DFS` pushes to maintain performance balance (controlled by `opts.LevelRebuildInterval`).

###Complexity & Advantages
- **Time**:  $$O(E\sqrt V)$$ on unit‐capacity networks; in practice near $$O(E\sqrt V)$$ for many graphs.
- **Memory**: $$O(V + E)$$ for residual capacities, level map, and iterators.
- Compared to Edmonds-Karp $$O(VE^2)$$ , Dinic typically offers an order‐of‐magnitude speedup on dense or high‐capacity graphs.

#### Pseudocode
```text
procedure Dinic(G, s, t):
  build residual capacities cap[u][v]
  maxFlow ← 0
  while true:
    # 1. Level Graph via BFS
    for each v in V: level[v] ← -1
    level[s] ← 0
    enqueue(s)
    while queue not empty:
      u ← dequeue()
      for each edge u→v with cap[u][v] > 0:
        if level[v] < 0:
          level[v] ← level[u] + 1
          enqueue(v)
    if level[t] < 0: break  # no more paths

    # 2. Build adjacency lists for level graph
    for each u in V:
      next[u] ← [v for v in neighbors(u) if cap[u][v] > 0 and level[v] = level[u] + 1]
      iter[u] ← 0

    # 3. DFS Blocking Flow
    while pushed ← dfs(s, t, ∞) > 0:
      maxFlow += pushed
    # optional: if opts.LevelRebuildInterval > 0 and reached count, break
  return maxFlow

function dfs(u, t, flow):
  if u = t: return flow
  for i from iter[u] to len(next[u])-1:
    v ← next[u][i]; iter[u] ← i + 1
    if cap[u][v] ≤ 0: continue
    send ← min(flow, cap[u][v])
    pushed ← dfs(v, t, send)
    if pushed > 0:
      cap[u][v] -= pushed
      cap[v][u] += pushed
      return pushed
  return 0
```

#### Highlights
- **Level Graph** filters out long detours, focusing search on shortest‐distance edges.
- **Blocking Flow** pushes multiple units of flow per `BFS`, reducing total rounds.
- **Optional Rebuild** allows tuning between overhead of BFS and cost of many `DFS` calls.

1. **Graph Details** (8 non‑source vertices + S + T, 22 directed edges):
   - **Vertices**: `S, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, T`.
   - **Edges & Capacities**: as listed in code (e.g.`(S→A)=5`,`(D→E)=7`,`(E→T)=12`,`(H→T)=4`).
2. **Level 0**: only `S`.
3. **Level 1**: all neighbors of `S` with positive capacity: `A(5), B(7), C(15)`.
4. **Level 2**: neighbors of Level 1 reachable via positive residuals and exactly one deeper: \
   • `D via A (9), E via A (3), E via B (2), E via C (5), F via C (10)`.
5. **Level 3**: from level‑2 nodes: \
   • `G via D (7), H via D (2), H via E (8), T via E (12), T via F (6)`.
6. **First blocking flow**: DFS finds disjoint shortest routes:
   - `S→A→D→G` is leaf (no T), skip.
   - `S→A→D→H` skip.
   - `S→A→E→T`: bottleneck = `min(5, 3, 12) = 3` → send 3.
   - `S→B→E→T`: with updated `E→T=9`, bottleneck = `min(7, 2, 9)=2` → send 2.
   - `S→C→E→T`: with `E→T=7`, bottleneck = `min(15,5,7)=5` → send 5.
   - `S→C→F→T`: `min(10,6)=6` → send 6. Total this phase = 3+2+5+6 = 16.
7. **Rebuild level graph** on updated residuals; repeat DFS pushes smaller remaining paths until `T` unreachable.

**Result** after all phases: **MaxFlow = 22**, the network’s total throughput under capacity constraints.

## 7.4. Pitfalls & Best Practices

1. **Integer overflow**  
   When capacities or numbers of augmentations are large, sums of flows can exceed 32-bit limits. Always use **int64** (or larger) for capacities and accumulators.

2. **Zero-capacity edges**  
   Edges with `(c(u,v)=0)` may clutter your residual graph - either filter them out early or ensure your algorithm skips them to avoid needless work.

3. **Choice of algorithm**
    - **Ford-Fulkerson (DFS)**: simple but worst-case $$\(O(E\cdot F)\)$$ may be prohibitive if `(F)` is large.
    - **Edmonds-Karp (BFS)**: polynomial $$\(O(V\,E^2)\)$$ guarantees, but can be slow on dense graphs.
    - **Dinic**: $$\(O(E\sqrt V)\)$$ on unit networks and often very fast in practice; preferred for large or dense graphs.

4. **Parallel edges and loops**
    - **Multi-edges**: `lvlath/core` by default **aggregates** parallel capacities - ensure this matches your model semantics.
    - **Loops** $$\((v\to v)\)$$: typically ignored in augmentation since they cannot contribute to source-sink throughput.

5. **Residual graph size**  
   Residual graph may have up to twice as many edges as the original (forward + backward). For huge networks, consider **streaming** or **out-of-core** techniques to limit memory.

6. **Precision and thresholds**  
   When capacities are floating-point, use an **epsilon** threshold to treat very small capacities as zero, avoiding infinite augmentation loops.

7. **Algorithm tuning**
    - **Verbose logging**: helpful for debugging small examples, but **disable** in benchmarks to avoid I/O overhead.
    - **LevelRebuildInterval** `Dinic`: in some variants, rebuilding the level graph after a fixed number of push operations can yield practical speedups-tune this parameter for your workloads.
